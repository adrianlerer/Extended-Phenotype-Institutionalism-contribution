## Prioritization Rubric (OpenAI-inspired)

| **Factor** | **Weight** | **Scoring** |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Academic impact (citations potential) | 40% | High=10, Medium=5, Low=2 |
| Effort (hours required) | 30% | <50h=10, 50-100h=5, >100h=2 |
| Reusability (can blueprints be reused?) | 20% | High=10, Medium=5, Low=2 |
| Strategic fit (advances EGT framework) | 10% | Yes=10, Partial=5, No=0 |

**Score** = Σ (Factor × Weight)  
**Priority** = High (>7.0), Medium (5.0-7.0), Low (<5.0)

## Current Prioritized Backlog

### P1: "Emergencia y Federalismo: Mutation Resistance in Federal Systems" (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status**: 💡 Idea → 📝 Draft (Target: Jan 2026)

**Research Question**:  
Why do federal systems (US, Germany, Canada) resist emergency power mutation better than unitary systems (Argentina, France)?

**Key Hypothesis**:  
G-function includes `federalism_strength` variable that increases institutional friction → reduces mutation probability.

**Expected Findings**:
- Quantify federalism_strength coefficient (β) in mutation equation
- Comparative case studies: Argentina (unitary) vs. Canada (federal)
- Validate with 20+ jurisdictions

**Blueprint Reuse**:
- ✅ METHODOLOGY_APPENDIX (adapt environmental variables)
- ✅ REALITY_FILTER_PROTOCOL (no changes needed)
- ✅ BIBLIOGRAPHY_TEMPLATE (expand with federalism sources)

**Estimated Effort**: 60 hours  
**Impact**: HIGH (novel contribution to EGT + federalism literature)  
**Priority Score**: 8.2/10 → **P1 (HIGH)**

**Timeline**:
- Jan 2026: Draft MVP (Checkpoint 1)
- Feb 2026: Pilot (Checkpoint 2)
- Mar 2026: Production → Submit to Comparative Constitutional Law Journal

### P2: "Anacronismo Ideológico en Fallos CSJN 1943-1955" (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status**: 💡 Idea

**Research Question**:  
How did Catholic nationalist rhetoric in CSJN opinions (1943-1955) create "temporal misalignment" that reduced doctrinal fitness post-1983 democratization?

**Key Hypothesis**:  
Doctrines using anacronistic language (e.g., "bien común" in Thomistic sense) had lower post-1983 fitness due to environmental mismatch.

**Expected Findings**:
- Linguistic analysis of 50+ CSJN opinions (1943-1955)
- Citation analysis post-1983: anacronistic doctrines had 0.3× fitness of neutral language doctrines
- Case study: Barra (1991) as "echo" of 1943-1955 language

**Blueprint Reuse**:
- ✅ METHODOLOGY_APPENDIX (citation analysis protocol)
- ⚠️ NEW: Linguistic analysis methods (requires new blueprint)
- ✅ REALITY_FILTER_PROTOCOL (no changes needed)

**Estimated Effort**: 80 hours (archival research + linguistic coding)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (niche topic, but novel method)  
**Priority Score**: 6.1/10 → **P2 (MEDIUM)**

**Timeline**:
- Mar-Apr 2026: Archival research
- May 2026: Draft MVP
- Jun 2026: Pilot → Submit to Argentine legal history journal

### P3: "G-Function Validation Across 47 Jurisdictions: A Global Test" (LOW PRIORITY - LONG-TERM)

**Status**: 💡 Idea

**Research Question**:  
Does the G-function predict doctrinal success in emergency powers across diverse legal systems (common law, civil law, Islamic law)?

**Key Hypothesis**:  
G(s, E) formula is universal, but environmental variable weights differ by legal tradition (e.g., `judicial_independence` matters more in common law).

**Expected Findings**:
- Comparative citation analysis across 47 jurisdictions (SSRN paper claimed this, but didn't execute)
- Validation of G-function β coefficients
- Refinement of environmental variables

**Blueprint Reuse**:
- ✅ METHODOLOGY_APPENDIX (G-function specification)
- ⚠️ NEW: Cross-national citation database (requires infrastructure)
- ✅ REALITY_FILTER_PROTOCOL (adapt for international cases)

**Estimated Effort**: 150 hours (+ potential RA assistance)  
**Impact**: HIGH (if successful, major validation of EGT framework)  
**Priority Score**: 5.5/10 → **P3 (LOW-MEDIUM)** (high impact, but very high effort)

**Timeline**:
- Q3 2026: Apply for research grant (requires funding)
- Q4 2026: Hire RA for data collection
- Q1 2027: Draft MVP (if funded)

## Backlog (Not Yet Prioritized)

### Paper Idea #4: "Judicial Independence as Evolutionary Constraint"
**Status**: 💡 Idea  
**One-liner**: Does judicial independence prevent mutation by increasing reversal probability?  
**Effort**: Medium (70h)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Score**: TBD (needs full rubric evaluation)

### Paper Idea #5: "LGBT Rights and 'Common Good' Rhetoric: A Fitness Test"
**Status**: 💡 Idea  
**One-liner**: How did "common good" arguments against LGBT rights perform in Argentine courts 2010-2025?  
**Effort**: Low (50h)  
**Impact**: Medium-High (policy relevance)  
**Score**: TBD

## Completed Papers (Archive)

### ✅ "General Welfare and Common Good as Evolutionary Stable Strategies" (Nov 2025)
**Status**: ✅ SSRN-ready (Reality Filter 99%)  
**Outcome**: 17,734 words, 7 sections, 38 references, 7 case citations  
**Lessons Learned**:
- Error detected: Banco de la Provincia (1940) description mismatch → Fixed via Reality Filter
- Blueprint value: 6 reusable components created (40-60% time savings for next paper)
- Governance lesson: Need formal Tier 3 verification for specific case claims
