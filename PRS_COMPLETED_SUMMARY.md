## 🎯 What This Accomplishes

### For Public Repository
1. **Professional organization**: Clear separation between Paper 1 (empirical) and Paper 2 (philosophical)
2. **Open science**: Complete outline publicly accessible for collaboration
3. **Dual-audience strategy**: README clearly distinguishes target communities
4. **Replication materials**: All materials for both papers in organized structure

### For Unified Repository (Private)
1. **Internal documentation**: Complete session record for future reference
2. **Writing roadmap**: 44-week timeline with milestones for Paper 2 execution
3. **Evidence audit**: All citations mapped and cross-referenced
4. **Strategic planning**: Competitive positioning, target journals, risk mitigation

### Strategic Benefits
1. **Cross-paper synergy**: Paper 1 and Paper 2 strengthen each other through cross-citation
2. **Audience diversification**: Reaches both empirical scientists and legal philosophers
3. **Publication pipeline**: Clear path from outline → literature review → drafting → submission
4. **Impact maximization**: Addresses foundational problem (Kelsen) using novel evidence (EPT)
