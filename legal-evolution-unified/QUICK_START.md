# 🚀 Quick Start - Legal Evolution Unified

**Current Status:** Repository structure ready, awaiting content from your AI Drive

---

## 📋 **What You Need to Do Right Now**

Since your AI Drive files are not accessible in this sandbox, here are your options:

### **Option 1: Tell Me What You Have (Fastest)**

Just list what you see in your AI Drive. Example:

```
In my AI Drive I have:
- A folder called "JurisRank_Argentina" with CSV files
- PDFs of my papers in "SSRN_Papers" folder  
- Some Excel files in "Datasets"
- Constitutional texts in "Legal_Corpus"
```

I'll create targeted instructions for each.

### **Option 2: Share Specific Files (Most Useful)**

**Start with these 3 critical files:**

1. **Main SSRN Paper** (PDF, ~84 pages)
   - This is the foundation for RAG (auto-citation in reports)
   - File probably named: `EPT_main_paper.pdf` or similar

2. **JurisRank Argentina Analysis** (CSV or JSON)
   - Citation network data
   - Probably named: `argentina_citations.csv` or similar

3. **Extended Reform Dataset** (CSV or Excel)
   - Beyond the 62 public reforms
   - Probably named: `reform_database_extended.csv`

**How to share:**
- Upload to chat if possible
- Or copy content and paste
- Or tell me the AI Drive path

### **Option 3: I Build MVP Without Your Files (Temporary)**

If locating files takes time, I can:

✅ **Build working demo in 1 week with:**
- Public data only (62 reforms from GitHub repo)
- Reconstructed theory (from our conversations)
- Basic ABM (3 agent types)
- Simple reports (no deep citations)

⚠️ **Limitations:**
- Reports won't cite your 84-page paper (no RAG)
- JurisRank not validated against your actual analysis
- Shallow theory integration

✅ **Benefits:**
- Working demo ASAP for testing UX
- You can add full content later
- Proves feasibility to potential clients

**Decision:** Do you want me to proceed with MVP now, or wait for full content?

## 🎯 **Recommended: Hybrid Approach**

**Week 1 (This Week):**
1. You locate 3 critical files (paper, JurisRank, dataset)
2. I integrate those 3 files
3. We have 70% functionality working

**Week 2-3:**
4. You add remaining files incrementally
5. I integrate each batch
6. Full system complete

**This way:** You don't need to find everything at once, and we make progress immediately.

## 💬 **What to Tell Me Right Now**

Copy this template and fill it out:

```
MY AI DRIVE CONTENT:

1. Papers:
   [ ] I have the main SSRN paper PDF
   [ ] I have other papers
   Location/names: _______________________

2. JurisRank:
   [ ] I have JurisRank analysis files
   [ ] I'm not sure what I have
   Location/names: _______________________

3. Datasets:
   [ ] I have extended datasets beyond public 62 reforms
   [ ] I only have the public data
   Location/names: _______________________

4. Case Studies:
   [ ] I have deep-dive analyses (Argentina, Uruguay, Chile)
   [ ] I have notes/drafts
   Location/names: _______________________

5. Legal Corpus:
   [ ] I have constitutional texts
   [ ] I have judicial decisions
   Location/names: _______________________

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
[ ] I'll share files now (starting with #_____)
[ ] I need time to locate files (ETA: _____)
[ ] Proceed with MVP using public data only for now
```

## ⚡ **If You Want to Move Fast**

**Just answer these 3 questions:**

1. **Do you have your main SSRN paper as a PDF?**
   - Yes → Share it or tell me the filename
   - No → I'll work with conversation notes

2. **Do you have JurisRank data files?**
   - Yes → Share one example file
   - Not sure → I'll recreate from methodology

3. **Should I start building now with public data, or wait for full content?**
   - Start now → MVP in 1 week
   - Wait → Full system in 2-3 weeks after files

---

## 🛠️ **What I'm Doing While Waiting**

While you locate files, I can:

1. ✅ **Implement CLI Calculator**
   ```python
   from analytical_engine.cli_calculator import CLICalculator
   # Already know the methodology from our discussion
   ```

2. ✅ **Create ABM Agent Skeleton**
   ```python
   from simulation_module.agents import WorkerAgent
   # Structure ready, needs calibration data
   ```

3. ✅ **Setup Report Templates**
   ```python
   from reporting_engine.templates import GovernmentBrief
   # Layout ready, needs theory content for RAG
   ```

These don't require your files yet. By the time you provide files, infrastructure is ready.
