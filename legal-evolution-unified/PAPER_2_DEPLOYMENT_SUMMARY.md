## 📋 PAPER 2 OUTLINE HIGHLIGHTS

### Core Argument
**Kelsen's Problem**: Grundnorm must be "presupposed" without justification (infinite regress problem)

**Our Resolution**: Grundnorm is not presupposed—it's **evolutionarily inherited**

### Evidence (Four Independent Streams)
1. **Primatology**: Proto-norms operate without language (Riedl 2012: 0% TPP in chimps, Leimgruber 2016: 25.7% intention-blind punishment in capuchins)
2. **Archaeology**: Normative exclusion predates complex language (0.67% Paleolithic → 27% Chalcolithic, χ²=11.89, p<0.001)
3. **Developmental Psychology**: Fairness emerges before deontic language (Hamann 2011: 3yo equity sharing)
4. **Neuroscience**: Norm-processing circuits predate language circuits (vmPFC ancient, Broca's area recent)

### Paper Structure
- **Part I** (Sections 1-3): The Problem - Kelsen's paradox and why philosophical solutions failed
- **Part II** (Sections 4-6): The Evolutionary Alternative - EPT framework and empirical evidence
- **Part III** (Sections 7-9): Implications & Objections - Legal theory implications and responses

### Key Contributions
1. **First empirical resolution** to Kelsen's Grundnorm problem in 100 years
2. **Novel application** of Extended Phenotype Theory to legal philosophy
3. **Integration** of four independent evidence streams
4. **Redefinition** of legal validity grounded in evolutionary biology

### Target Journals (Ranked)
1. **Philosophy & Public Affairs** (5-8% acceptance) - Top target
2. **Legal Theory** (Cambridge) (10-15% acceptance) - Strong alternative
3. **Oxford Journal of Legal Studies** (12-18% acceptance) - UK positivism tradition

### Writing Timeline
- **Phase 1** (4-6 weeks): Deep literature review (Kelsen + empirical studies)
- **Phase 2** (12-16 weeks): Drafting (section by section, 80-85 pages)
- **Phase 3** (8-12 weeks): Revision (5 complete passes)
- **Phase 4** (2-4 weeks): External review and journal submission

**Total estimated time**: 26-38 weeks (6-9 months)

## 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS

### Strategic Value
- **Paper 1** establishes EPT framework with broad empirical evidence
- **Paper 2** uses EPT to solve specific foundational problem in legal philosophy
- **Two audiences**: Evolutionary scientists (Paper 1) + Legal philosophers (Paper 2)
- **Cross-citation**: Papers strengthen each other

### Impact Potential
- Kelsen is THE most cited figure in 20th century legal philosophy
- Resolving Grundnorm paradox empirically (not philosophically) is **methodologically revolutionary**
- Opens new research agenda: mapping inherited proto-norms using neuroscience + developmental psychology

### Competitive Positioning
- **Unlike Hart**: We don't just replace Grundnorm with "rule of recognition" (moves problem one step)
- **Unlike Raz**: We don't presume rational agency (begs question)
- **Unlike natural law**: We don't appeal to "self-evident" basic goods (circular)
- **We ground normativity in evolutionary adaptation** - terminates regress without circularity

### Kelsen Primary Sources (Must-Cite)
1. Kelsen (1934) - Reine Rechtslehre (original)
2. Kelsen (1945) - General Theory of Law and State
3. Kelsen (1960) - Reine Rechtslehre (2nd ed., revised)
4. Kelsen (1967) - Pure Theory of Law (standard English reference)

### Post-Kelsen Responses (Must Engage)
- Hart (1961) - *Concept of Law* (rule of recognition)
- Raz (1979) - *Authority of Law* (exclusionary reasons)
- Alexy (1992) - *Argument from Injustice* (discourse theory)

### Evolutionary Biology Core
- Dawkins (1982) - *Extended Phenotype* (foundational)
- Boyd & Richerson (1985) - *Culture and Evolutionary Process*
- Bowles & Gintis (2011) - *A Cooperative Species*

### New Empirical Studies Needed
- Hamann et al. (2011) - Collaborative fairness age 3
- Vaish et al. (2011) - Early third-party punishment
- Schmidt & Tomasello (2012) - Normative enforcement 3yo
- Moll et al. (2008) - Neural basis moral cognition
- Sanfey et al. (2003) - Ultimatum Game fMRI
- Decety et al. (2012) - Developmental neuroscience fairness

## 💡 NEXT STEPS (When Ready to Write)

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Push commit to GitHub**: `git push origin main`
2. **Verify repo structure** on GitHub web interface
3. **Share repo link** with potential collaborators

### Phase 1: Literature Review (Weeks 1-6)
1. **Week 1-2**: Read all four Kelsen texts cover-to-cover
2. **Week 3-4**: Deep read of Hart, Raz, Alexy, Dworkin, Finnis
3. **Week 5-6**: Systematic review of developmental psych + neuroscience studies

**Deliverable**: Evidence matrix with all N, statistics, citations verified

### Phase 2: Begin Drafting (Week 7+)
Start with Section 1 (Introduction):
- Open with Supreme Court authority regress example
- Introduce Grundnorm problem
- Preview EPT solution
- 6 pages, 3,000 words

**Timeline**: See complete 44-week plan in outline document

*"The Grundnorm is not presupposed—it is inherited. We do not presuppose the capacity for law any more than we presuppose the capacity for language. Both are gifts of our evolutionary past."*
