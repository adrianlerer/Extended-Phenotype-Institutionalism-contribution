## New Evidence Needed for Paper 2

### Developmental Psychology (New)

#### Target Study 1: Hamann et al. (2011) - Collaborative Fairness
**Full Citation**: Hamann, K., Warneken, F., Greenberg, J. R., & Tomasello, M. (2011). Collaboration encourages equal sharing in children but not in chimpanzees. *Nature*, 476(7360), 328-331.

**Key Data**:
- **N=48** 3-year-old children
- **N=12** adult chimpanzees
- **Task**: Collaborative apparatus requiring coordination, then resource division
- **Result (humans)**: Children share equitably with collaborative partners (but not strangers)
- **Result (chimps)**: Chimpanzees do NOT share equitably even after collaboration
- **Interpretation**: Human-unique norm of partner-specific fairness

**Use in Paper 2**:
- Section 5.4.1: Demonstrate fairness before full deontic language competence
- Argument: If 3yo children show fairness but deontic language emerges at 5-7yo, then fairness ≠ linguistic articulation

#### Target Study 2: Vaish et al. (2011) - Early Third-Party Punishment
**Full Citation**: Vaish, A., Missana, M., & Tomasello, M. (2011). Three-year-old children intervene in third-party moral transgressions. *British Journal of Developmental Psychology*, 29(1), 124-130.

**Key Data**:
- **N=36** children (3yo)
- **Task**: Observe third-party harming property or person
- **Result**: Children protest and intervene against harm-doer
- **Critical**: This is BEFORE full theory of mind (age 4-5)

**Use in Paper 2**:
- Section 5.4.1: Show proto-normative enforcement before sophisticated mental state reasoning
- Connects to Kelsen: Norm-enforcement psychology predates reflective justification

#### Target Study 3: Schmidt & Tomasello (2012) - Normative Enforcement 3yo
**Full Citation**: Schmidt, M. F., & Tomasello, M. (2012). Young children enforce social norms. *Current Directions in Psychological Science*, 21(4), 232-236.

**Key Data**:
- Children as young as 3yo protest when others break rules
- Protest even when child has no stake in outcome (true third-party)
- Critical: Protest occurs for arbitrary rules (not just harm-based)

**Use in Paper 2**:
- Section 5.4.1: Demonstrates rule-following independent of harm detection
- Supports: Grundnorm-like "follow the rules" meta-norm emerges early

### Neuroscience (New)

#### Target Study 1: Moll et al. (2008) - Neural Basis of Moral Cognition
**Full Citation**: Moll, J., de Oliveira-Souza, R., & Zahn, R. (2008). The neural basis of moral cognition. *Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences*, 1124(1), 161-180.

**Key Data**:
- fMRI meta-analysis of moral judgment studies
- Consistent activation: vmPFC, anterior temporal lobe, posterior STS
- These regions are phylogenetically OLD (present in all primates)

**Use in Paper 2**:
- Section 5.5.1: Demonstrate norm-processing circuits predate language-specialized regions
- Argument: If Grundnorm were purely linguistic, we'd expect language areas to be primary

#### Target Study 2: Sanfey et al. (2003) - Ultimatum Game fMRI
**Full Citation**: Sanfey, A. G., Rilling, J. K., Aronson, J. A., Nystrom, L. E., & Cohen, J. D. (2003). The neural basis of economic decision-making in the Ultimatum Game. *Science*, 300(5626), 1755-1758.

**Key Data**:
- Unfair offers activate anterior insula (disgust region)
- Insula activation predicts rejection of unfair offers
- Insula is ancient structure (interoception in all mammals)

**Use in Paper 2**:
- Section 5.5.2: Show visceral, pre-reflective response to unfairness
- Connects to Kelsen: "Ought" feeling has subcortical, automatic component

#### Target Study 3: Decety et al. (2012) - Early Neural Sensitivity to Fairness
**Full Citation**: Decety, J., Michalska, K. J., & Kinzler, K. D. (2012). The contribution of emotion and cognition to moral sensitivity: A neurodevelopmental study. *Cerebral Cortex*, 22(1), 209-220.

**Key Data**:
- Children age 4-6 show amygdala and vmPFC activation to unfair scenarios
- Pattern similar to adults (but with stronger emotional reactivity)
- Supports: Neural substrate for fairness detection present early

**Use in Paper 2**:
- Section 5.5.3: Ontogenetic evidence for early norm-processing neural circuits
- Argument: Neural maturation timeline supports proto-norm → articulated norm trajectory

### Kelsen Primary Sources (Essential)

#### Must-Cite Kelsen Works

   - Original formulation of Pure Theory
   - First systematic treatment of Grundnorm

2. **Kelsen, H. (1945).** *General Theory of Law and State*. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.
   - English-language exposition
   - Accessible to Anglo-American audience

3. **Kelsen, H. (1960).** *Reine Rechtslehre* (2nd ed.). Vienna: Deuticke.
   - Revised formulation (significant changes from 1934)
   - More neo-Kantian emphasis

4. **Kelsen, H. (1967).** *Pure Theory of Law* (2nd ed., M. Knight, Trans.). Berkeley: University of California Press.
   - Standard English reference
   - Most-cited version

5. **Kelsen, H. (1964).** "On the Concept of Norm." In *Essays in Legal and Moral Philosophy* (pp. 216-256). Dordrecht: Reidel.
   - Late-career reflection on normativity
   - Shows continued struggle with Grundnorm justification

#### Key Kelsen Quotes to Use

**On Grundnorm as presupposed** (Pure Theory 1967, p. 201):
> "The basic norm is not created in a legal procedure by a law-creating organ. It is not—as a positive legal norm is—valid because it is created in a certain way by a legal act, but it is valid because it is presupposed to be valid."

**On necessity of Grundnorm** (Pure Theory 1967, p. 204):
> "The basic norm is not valid because it has been created in a certain way, but its validity is presupposed, and it is presupposed because without this presupposition no human act could be interpreted as a legal, especially as a norm-creating, act."

**On Grundnorm as transcendental** (Pure Theory 1967, p. 202):
> "The basic norm is the presupposed starting point of a procedure: the procedure of positive law creation. It is not created by a legal procedure, but it is presupposed to be valid by the jurist who interprets the acts as legal."

**Admission of problem** (General Theory 1945, p. 116):
> "The basic norm is not a positive norm: it is not posited by a real act of will, but is presupposed in juristic thinking."

### Post-Kelsen Positivist Responses (Must Engage)

#### Hart, H.L.A. (1961). *The Concept of Law*. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
**Key argument**: 
- Rule of recognition as social fact replaces Grundnorm
- Officials accept rule from "internal point of view"
- No need for Kelsen's transcendental presupposition

**Our response location**: Section 3.1
**Our critique**: Hart just moves problem one step back (what grounds "internal point of view"?)

#### Raz, J. (1979). *The Authority of Law*. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
**Key argument**:
- Law claims legitimate authority
- Authority provides exclusionary reasons
- Grundnorm unnecessary if we understand practical reasoning

**Our response location**: Section 3.2
**Our critique**: Raz presumes antecedent normative commitments (rationality, accepting exclusionary reasons)

#### Alexy, R. (1992). *The Argument from Injustice*. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
**Key argument**:
- Legal validity requires "correctness claim"
- Correctness justified through rational discourse
- Procedural replacement for Grundnorm

**Our response location**: Section 3.3
**Our critique**: Discourse participants must already accept discourse norms—regress returns

#### Shapiro, S. (2011). *Legality*. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.
**Key argument**:
- Law is planning institution
- Legal validity grounded in planning rationality
- No need for Grundnorm

**Our response location**: Section 3.6 (contemporary alternatives)
**Our critique**: Why should we participate in legal planning? Presumes commitment to planning rationality.

### Natural Law Responses (Must Engage)

#### Finnis, J. (1980). *Natural Law and Natural Rights*. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
**Key argument**:
- Basic goods knowable through practical reason
- Legal authority derives from promoting basic goods
- No need for Grundnorm—natural law provides foundation

**Our response location**: Section 3.5
**Our critique**: Basic goods are asserted, not derived; "self-evidence" is just another presupposition

#### Fuller, L. (1969). *The Morality of Law* (2nd ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.
**Key argument**:
- Law has internal morality (eight desiderata: clarity, generality, etc.)
- Legal validity grounded in procedural morality
- Grundnorm unnecessary

**Our response location**: Section 3.5
**Our critique**: Why value procedural desiderata? Fuller can't answer without circularity.
