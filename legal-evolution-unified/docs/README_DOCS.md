# Documentation Index - Legal Evolution Unified

## Recent Additions (October 2025)

### Constitutional Lock-in Index (CLI) Framework
**Location**: `docs/constitutional-lockin-index/`

- **CLI_FRAMEWORK.md** - Comprehensive framework for measuring constitutional irreformability
  - 5-component composite index (Text Vagueness, Judicial Activism, Treaty Hierarchy, Precedent Weight, Amendment Difficulty)
  - 10-country comparative analysis
  - Statistical validation: R² = 0.74 predictive power
  - Key finding: Explicit entrenchment clauses do NOT predict irreformability (r=-0.18, p=0.43)
  - CLI scores DO predict reform failure (r=-0.89, p<0.001)

### Precedent Genealogical Analysis
**Location**: `docs/precedent-analysis/`

- **GENEALOGIA_PRECEDENTES_CSJN_LABORALES.md** - RootFinder protocol applied to Argentine Supreme Court labor precedents (1969-2024)
  - Verified citation chains in primary sources (Aquino, Vizzoti, Madorrán)
  - Falsified common narrative: "Nordenskjöld (1984)" is apocryphal precedent not cited in any case
  - Established true genealogy: Gunther (1984) → Aquino-Vizzoti díada (2004) → Madorrán (2007)
  - Documented strategic doctrine invocation: 87% by unions vs 6.5% baseline
  - Falsified Bidart Campos' "social consensus" claim: 67% public support vs 0% reform success

## Integration with Existing Framework

These analyses extend the Legal Evolution Unified platform's capabilities:

1. **Precedent Analysis Tools** - RootFinder protocol for phylogenetic analysis of case law
2. **Constitutional Lock-in Metrics** - Quantitative framework for measuring irreformability
3. **Reality Filter Methodology** - Applied throughout with 5 confirmed + 3 falsified findings
4. **Cross-National Comparative Method** - 10-country analysis with statistical controls

## Relationship to Existing Docs

- Complements `ANALYSIS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` with constitutional law focus
- Extends `PSM_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md` methodology to legal precedent analysis
- Provides case study for `REPLICATION_GUIDE.md` framework

## For SSRN Publication

Materials in `constitutional-lockin-index/` are being prepared for SSRN working paper:
- Title: "Operationalizing Constitutional Irreformability: The Lock-in Index Framework"
- Audience: Comparative constitutional law and institutional economics

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add `data/cli-scores/` with CSV files for 10-country dataset
- [ ] Add `figures/cli-analysis/` with correlation plots
- [ ] Integrate CLI metrics into main platform analytics
- [ ] Expand precedent analysis to other jurisdictions (Brazil STF, India SC, Germany BVerfG)
