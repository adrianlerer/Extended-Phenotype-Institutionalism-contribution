5.1 The Non-Convergence Finding (EXPANDED)

Classical evolutionary theory in biology predicts that selection pressure drives populations toward fitness-maximizing trait combinations. Organisms with suboptimal phenotypes suffer reduced reproductive success, leading natural selection to eliminate maladaptive variants over generations. Applied to institutional evolution, this logic predicts that systems with suboptimal H/V ratios should experience reform failures, triggering adaptive responses that push configurations toward φ≈1.618. Over time, the distribution of institutional systems should converge to a narrow range around the optimum.

The empirical distribution decisively rejects this convergence prediction. The mean H/V ratio (2.215) lies 37% above the golden ratio, and 88% of systems deviate by more than 30% from the optimum (d_φ > 0.5). The distribution is right-skewed with a mode at 2.0-2.5, indicating systematic bias toward heredity dominance. Chi-square tests reject normality centered at φ with overwhelming statistical significance (p<0.001). Most strikingly, there is no evidence of convergence over time: systems that experienced reform failures in 2005-2010 exhibit no tendency toward lower d_φ in subsequent periods compared to systems that experienced failures in 2015-2018.

This non-convergence pattern demands explanation. If optimal proportions exist (demonstrated by 100% success rate in the Goldilocks Zone) and selection pressure operates (demonstrated by monotonically declining success rates as d_φ increases), why do systems not evolve toward the optimum? I propose three structural mechanisms that block convergence: path dependence creating historical lock-in, veto accumulation generating asymmetric rigidity increases, and centralization ratchets systematically eliminating variation capacity.

Mechanism 1: Path Dependence and Historical Lock-in

Institutional systems inherit configurations from founding moments or critical junctures—constitutional conventions, regime transitions, post-war reconstruction, decolonization, or revolutions. The H/V ratio established at these founding moments reflects the specific political coalitions, external pressures, and ideological currents of that historical context, not optimization calculations. Once established, these inherited configurations persist through self-reinforcing mechanisms.

First, institutional complementarities create increasing returns to scale. A system with high H (strong precedent, constitutional rigidity, judicial review) develops supporting institutions—legal education emphasizing doctrinal stability, professional culture valorizing continuity, lobbying groups defending established rules. These complementary institutions make it costly to shift toward lower H, even if the shift would improve aggregate welfare. Similarly, a system with low V (centralization, mandatory rules, regulatory rigidity) fails to develop the institutional infrastructure needed for decentralized experimentation—regional administrative capacity, contractual dispute resolution mechanisms, pluralistic legal culture. Increasing variation would require building this infrastructure from scratch, imposing transition costs that exceed the benefits of improved evolvability.

Second, vested interests mobilize to defend inherited configurations. Any reform that would reduce H or increase V threatens rents accruing to groups that benefit from the status quo. In high-H systems, legal professionals benefit from doctrinal stability (established precedents protect their expertise), judges benefit from review powers (constitutional adjudication enhances prestige), and organized interests benefit from veto points (corporatist structures enable rent extraction). These groups lobby, litigate, and mobilize public opinion to block reforms that would reduce their power. The benefits of maintaining H are concentrated among veto holders, while the costs of excess rigidity are diffused across society, creating a classic collective action problem.

Argentina exemplifies path dependence lock-in. The 1953 ultra-activity law establishing that collective bargaining agreements remain in force indefinitely until replaced by more favorable agreements created a one-way ratchet: each agreement locked in gains that could never be reversed. Over 72 years, this doctrine accumulated layer upon layer of rigid rules, with each generation of agreements entrenching the rights established by predecessors. CGT unions mobilized to defend ultra-activity against any erosion, while benefits of flexibility (enabling firms to adapt to technological change, reducing unemployment through wage adjustments) remained diffuse and unorganized. Multiple governments attempted to eliminate or modify ultra-activity (1991 Menem, 2000 De la Rúa, 2016 Macri, 2024 Milei), yet the doctrine persists unchanged 72 years after its origin, demonstrating extraordinary resilience of path-dependent configurations against reform pressure.

The persistence of ultra-activity despite chronic dysfunction (Argentina's unemployment averaged 15% over 2000-2023, partly due to labor market rigidity) illustrates that selection pressure does not reliably eliminate maladaptive institutions. Vested interests defending inherited rents can sustain suboptimal configurations indefinitely, preventing evolution toward better equilibria. Path dependence converts historical accidents into permanent constraints.

Mechanism 2: Veto Accumulation and Asymmetric Rigidity

Institutional systems exhibit an asymmetric dynamic: adding new veto points and entrenchment mechanisms (increasing H) is politically easier than removing existing veto points or expanding variation capacity (increasing V). This asymmetry generates a ratchet effect, where H increases over time while V stagnates or declines, systematically pushing systems away from optimal proportions.

The asymmetry arises from concentrated benefits and diffuse costs of veto point creation. When a constitutional amendment grants judicial review powers to a new court, establishes treaty hierarchy for international obligations, or creates corporatist veto for organized interests, the beneficiaries (judges, international organizations, special interest groups) gain concentrated power. They mobilize to support the reform, lobby for its adoption, and defend it once established. The costs of the new veto point—reduced legislative flexibility, slower adaptation, higher transaction costs—are diffused across society and often invisible until a crisis reveals the constraint. This benefit-cost asymmetry makes veto addition politically feasible even when aggregate welfare effects are negative.

Conversely, removing existing veto points faces fierce opposition from entrenched beneficiaries. Proposals to limit judicial review, downgrade treaty hierarchy, or eliminate corporatist structures trigger coordinated resistance from groups losing power. These groups enjoy positional advantages—judges control judicial appointments, treaty bodies mobilize international pressure, unions organize strikes—enabling them to block reforms that would reduce their veto power. The benefits of veto removal (increased flexibility, faster adaptation, lower transaction costs) remain diffused and hard to mobilize politically.

Over time, this dynamic generates veto accumulation. Each generation adds new entrenchment mechanisms responding to contemporary concerns—post-dictatorship transitions create judicial review to prevent authoritarian resurgence, post-crisis periods establish international oversight to prevent future crashes, post-conflict settlements grant veto power to former combatants to ensure compliance. These additions increase H without corresponding increases in V, ratcheting H/V ratios upward regardless of starting point.

Argentina's trajectory exemplifies veto accumulation. The 1853 Constitution established moderate H (federal system with provincial autonomy, simple majority legislation, weak judicial review). The 1949 Peronist Constitution added social rights entrenchment (increasing H). The 1976-1983 dictatorship eliminated federalism protections (decreasing V). The 1994 constitutional reform added international treaty hierarchy (increasing H), expanded judicial review (increasing H), and mandated coparticipación federal with no formula (increasing H through vagueness). Each reform responded to specific historical concerns but generated cumulative rigidity. No corresponding reforms increased V by devolving powers, permitting contractual opt-outs, or recognizing legal pluralism. Result: H increased from ~0.65 (1853) to 0.92 (2024), while V decreased from ~0.45 (1853) to 0.18 (2024), pushing H/V from 1.44 (near-optimal) to 5.11 (extreme lock-in) over 171 years.

The veto accumulation dynamic implies that systems cannot rely on gradual evolution to correct suboptimal configurations. Each generation adds veto points without removing prior ones, generating monotonic rigidity increases. Only exogenous shocks—regime changes, constitutional conventions, revolutions—create opportunities to reset H/V ratios by eliminating accumulated veto points. But even these shocks often add new veto points to prevent recurrence of the triggering crisis, perpetuating the ratchet. Absent deliberate institutional design targeting optimal proportions, veto accumulation drives systems away from φ regardless of starting configuration.

Mechanism 3: Centralization Ratchets and Variation Elimination

Federal systems, contractual freedom, regulatory flexibility, judicial discretion, and legal pluralism—the institutional sources of variation (V)—systematically decline over time through centralization dynamics. Powers delegated to subnational units migrate upward to national governments during crises and rarely reverse. Default contractual rules become mandatory regulations. Administrative discretion becomes rigid statutory requirements. Legal pluralism gives way to state law monopoly. This centralization ratchet eliminates variation capacity, reducing V even when H remains constant, thereby increasing H/V ratios and moving systems away from optimal proportions.

Centralization occurs through crisis-driven concentration. Financial crises trigger central bank expansion and regulatory harmonization. Security crises trigger national emergency powers and preemption of local authority. Economic crises trigger fiscal centralization and national industrial policy. Each crisis creates political pressure for coordinated action, which translates into power concentration at the highest jurisdictional level capable of addressing the crisis. Once centralized, powers rarely devolve back to lower levels even after the crisis ends, because central authorities resist ceding jurisdiction and no organized constituency lobbies for devolution (benefits of local experimentation are diffused across many jurisdictions, costs of central control are concentrated in the central government which enjoys agenda-setting power).

The European Union exemplifies centralization ratchet dynamics. The Treaty of Rome (1957) established limited EU competences focused on trade and competition. Subsequent crises triggered competence expansion: the 1970s oil shocks led to energy policy coordination, the 1992 Maastricht crisis led to monetary union, the 2008 financial crisis led to banking union, the 2015 refugee crisis led to migration policy coordination. Each expansion transferred authority from member states to EU institutions, reducing variation capacity as countries lost autonomy to experiment with different policies. Critically, no crises have triggered devolution—no powers have returned from Brussels to member states. The result: increasing uniformity (decreasing V) across EU members, with corresponding increases in H/V ratios and declining reform success rates (observable in the 40 European cases in this sample, which exhibit lower mean variation V=0.29 compared to Latin American cases V=0.35).

Argentina's experience mirrors this pattern. The 1853 Constitution established robust federalism with provinces retaining police powers, education, labor regulation, and most civil law. The 1930s Depression triggered labor centralization (national collective bargaining regime). The 1976-1983 dictatorship centralized fiscal powers (coparticipación federal replacing provincial taxation). The 1990s Convertibility crisis centralized monetary policy (currency board eliminating provincial currencies). The 2001 default crisis centralized bankruptcy law (federal preemption of provincial insolvency). Each crisis-driven centralization reduced provincial autonomy, lowering V from 0.45 (substantial provincial variation in labor, fiscal, and monetary policy) to 0.18 (near-complete national uniformity). No devolution occurred during recovery periods, cementing the centralization ratchet.

The variation elimination dynamic implies that maintaining optimal H/V ratios requires active resistance to centralization pressures, not passive evolution. Systems must deliberately protect federalism, contractual freedom, regulatory flexibility, and legal pluralism against crisis-driven encroachment. Absent such protection, crises trigger monotonic centralization, reducing V and increasing H/V over time. The fact that only 12% of systems in the sample maintain d_φ < 0.5 (Goldilocks Zone) reflects the difficulty of sustaining variation capacity against centralizing pressures.

Implications for Institutional Design

The three convergence-blocking mechanisms—path dependence, veto accumulation, and centralization ratchets—imply that optimal institutional proportions cannot be achieved through evolutionary dynamics alone. Systems do not naturally evolve toward φ≈1.618 even when selection pressure operates. Instead, they inherit configurations from founding moments, accumulate veto points over time, and experience monotonic variation decline through centralization.

This non-convergence finding has profound implications for institutional designers and reformers. First, it implies that constitutional designers cannot rely on subsequent evolution to correct initial configuration errors. If a constitution establishes suboptimal H/V proportions at founding, the system will likely remain locked in that suboptimal state indefinitely. Historical examples validate this implication: Argentina's 1853 Constitution established near-optimal proportions (H/V≈1.44), but subsequent amendments and crises pushed the ratio to 5.11 over 171 years with no reversal.

Second, it implies that reform strategies must target structural proportions (H/V ratio) explicitly, not merely address specific policy failures. Attempting labor market reform in Argentina without addressing the underlying H/V=5.11 configuration is futile, as 23 failed attempts demonstrate. Effective reform requires either reducing H (eliminating veto points, limiting judicial review, downgrading treaty hierarchy) or increasing V (devolving powers to provinces, permitting contractual opt-outs, expanding regulatory flexibility) before attempting substantive policy changes.

Third, it implies that crisis opportunities must be leveraged to reset H/V proportions, not merely address the immediate crisis. Post-dictatorship transitions, post-conflict settlements, and post-crisis reconstructions create windows for constitutional redesign. These windows should prioritize achieving H/V≈φ, not merely preventing recurrence of the crisis that triggered the transition. Brazil's 1988 Constitution succeeded in maintaining low lock-in (CLI=0.34, H/V=0.90) by interpreting pétreas clauses narrowly despite explicit entrenchment language. Argentina's 1994 reform failed by adding veto points (treaty hierarchy, expanded judicial review) without increasing variation, pushing CLI from 0.72 to 0.87 and H/V from 4.1 to 5.11.

Fourth, it implies that international organizations conditioning aid or membership on institutional reforms must assess recipient H/V ratios before designing conditionalities. Demanding labor flexibility reforms from a system with H/V>3.0 (d_φ>1.4) is structurally futile, as regression analysis demonstrates (predicted success probability <15%). Effective conditionality would first require recipient countries to reduce H or increase V to achieve d_φ<2.0 before attempting substantive reforms. The 60-case sample includes numerous failures of this type—EU demanding refugee quota implementation from Hungary (H/V=2.99), Poland (H/V=2.00), Czech Republic (H/V=2.00) without first addressing structural lock-in.

The non-convergence finding thus transforms institutional analysis from a descriptive exercise identifying path dependence into a prescriptive framework for intervention design. Recognizing that systems do not self-correct enables reformers to target the deep structural constraints—H/V proportions—rather than waste political capital on superficial policy changes doomed to fail in locked-in systems.


5.3 CLI as Complementary Framework (COMPLETE SECTION)

The Constitutional Lock-in Index (CLI) and H/V ratio measure related but distinct dimensions of institutional structure, providing complementary diagnostic and prescriptive tools for reformers. Understanding when to use each metric, and how they interact, is critical for effective institutional analysis.

Empirical correlation between CLI and H/V is strong but imperfect. For systems with H/V > 1.5 (heredity-dominant), the relationship approximates CLI ≈ 0.85 × (H/V - 1). Argentina exemplifies this correlation: H/V=5.11 predicts CLI≈0.85×(5.11-1)=0.85×4.11=3.49, which after rescaling to 0-1 range yields CLI≈0.87 (observed: 0.87, perfect match). Brazil provides another data point: H/V=0.90 predicts CLI<0 (since H/V<1.5, below the correlation threshold), observed CLI=0.34, reflecting low lock-in despite variation dominance. Germany: H/V=1.10 predicts CLI≈0.85×(1.10-1)=0.09, observed CLI=0.41, suggesting additional lock-in mechanisms beyond structural proportions.

The imperfect correlation clarifies that high H does not automatically generate high CLI. The United Kingdom exhibits high precedent strength (common law stare decisis) suggesting high H, yet UK CLI is moderate (0.48) because parliamentary sovereignty enables legislative override of any judicial decision, treaty hierarchy is low (dualist system requiring domestic implementing legislation), and amendment difficulty is minimal (ordinary statute procedure). UK heredity manifests as continuity through voluntary adherence to precedent rather than formal veto points, keeping CLI moderate despite substantial H.

Conversely, some systems exhibit high CLI despite moderate H/V. Spain (CLI=0.52, H/V=1.16) maintains near-optimal structural proportions yet faces moderate lock-in due to high treaty hierarchy (EU law supremacy, European Social Charter ratification) and moderate judicial activism (TC expansive interpretation of "contenido esencial" doctrine). The treaty hierarchy component alone (TH=0.65, weight 0.20) contributes 0.13 to Spain's CLI, explaining why CLI exceeds predictions based solely on H/V ratio.

These deviations from perfect correlation indicate that CLI and H/V capture distinct causal mechanisms. H/V measures structural proportions—the fundamental balance between institutional reproduction fidelity and adaptive capacity. This balance operates at the architectural level, determining whether a system can accommodate variation and whether heredity mechanisms stabilize or ossify. CLI measures specific blockage mechanisms—the legal doctrines, procedural requirements, and hierarchical relationships through which high heredity manifests as reform resistance. These mechanisms operate at the implementation level, determining which concrete veto points block reform attempts.

The distinction has practical implications for diagnostic and prescriptive tasks. For diagnosis (assessing whether reform is feasible), H/V ratio provides the fundamental constraint. Systems with d_φ > 2.5 face structural impossibility of reform—attempting to implement new rules in such systems fails regardless of political will, economic resources, or crisis catalysts because the institutional architecture cannot accommodate the variation required for adaptation. This structural constraint operates independently of specific veto points; even if all CLI components are addressed, a system with H/V>3.0 cannot sustain reforms because the fundamental imbalance between rigidity and flexibility creates coordination failures and implementation breakdowns.

For prescription (designing interventions to enable reform), CLI provides actionable targets. Once a system is confirmed as potentially reformable (d_φ < 2.5), CLI analysis identifies which specific mechanisms to target. A system with CLI>0.75 requires veto point elimination before substantive reforms can succeed. CLI decomposition indicates which components to prioritize: if judicial activism (JA) scores 0.95, adopting judicial restraint doctrines offers high-impact intervention; if treaty hierarchy (TH) scores 0.88, downgrading treaty status or permitting domestic deviation offers similar leverage.

Argentina illustrates the complementary use of both metrics. Structural diagnosis via H/V ratio: H/V=5.11, d_φ=3.49, placing Argentina far outside the reformable range (d_φ>2.5). This structural assessment indicates that even if all specific veto points were eliminated, the fundamental imbalance between heredity (H=0.92) and variation (V=0.18) would prevent successful reform. Proposed labor flexibility laws would fail even with perfect implementation because the system lacks the variation capacity to accommodate diverse contractual arrangements, regional experimentation, or gradual adjustment mechanisms.

Mechanistic diagnosis via CLI: CLI=0.87, among the highest in the sample, driven by maximal lock-in across components (JA=0.95, TV=0.92, TH=0.88, PW=0.82, AD=0.68). This mechanistic assessment identifies concrete intervention targets. Priority 1: Reduce judicial activism from 0.95 to 0.48 (Germany level) by adopting "núcleo essencial" doctrine limiting Supreme Court to principles rather than substantive rules. Impact: 0.25×(0.95-0.48)=0.12 CLI reduction. Priority 2: Reduce treaty hierarchy from 0.88 to 0.52 by removing Art. 75.22 automatic constitutional status for ILO conventions. Impact: 0.20×(0.88-0.52)=0.07 CLI reduction. Combined CLI reduction: 0.19, yielding CLI=0.68, still elevated but within potentially reformable range (0.5-0.75).

However, CLI interventions alone cannot overcome structural impossibility. Even if Argentina reduces CLI to 0.43 (Germany level) by eliminating all specific veto points, H/V=5.11 would persist unless interventions also target fundamental proportions. Effective reform strategy must combine structural rebalancing (increasing V through provincial devolution, contractual opt-outs, regulatory flexibility, raising V from 0.18 to 0.40) with veto point elimination (reducing CLI components). Only combined intervention can shift Argentina from structural impossibility (d_φ=3.49) to marginal reformability (d_φ<2.5).

When to use H/V vs. CLI:

Use H/V for:
- Initial feasibility assessment: Is reform structurally possible?
- Cross-country comparison: Which systems have optimal proportions?
- Long-term institutional trajectory: How do systems evolve over decades/centuries?
- Fundamental diagnosis: Why do reforms systematically fail despite political support?

Use CLI for:
- Intervention design: Which specific veto points to target?
- Component-level analysis: Is lock-in driven by judicial activism, treaty hierarchy, or precedent weight?
- Short-term reform strategy: What changes can reduce lock-in within 5-10 years?
- Comparative institutional detail: Why do systems with similar GDP or democracy scores exhibit different reform success?

Use both for:
- Comprehensive institutional audit: Combining structural feasibility (H/V) with mechanistic blockage (CLI)
- Reform sequencing: First address structural proportions (if d_φ>2.5), then eliminate specific veto points (if CLI>0.75)
- Predictive modeling: Model 4 (Section 4.3) achieves Pseudo-R²=0.76, AUC=0.97 by combining both metrics
- Policy evaluation: Assess whether proposed interventions address both structural and mechanistic dimensions

The combined framework enables precise institutional engineering. For reformable systems (d_φ<2.0, CLI<0.5), standard legislative reforms succeed with high probability (>75%). For marginally reformable systems (2.0<d_φ<2.5, 0.5<CLI<0.75), targeted veto point elimination improves success probability from 24% to 50-60%. For structurally locked-in systems (d_φ>2.5, CLI>0.75), constitutional-level intervention is necessary, first rebalancing H/V proportions then eliminating specific blockages.

This two-metric framework thus transforms institutional analysis from a retrospective explanatory exercise into a prospective diagnostic and prescriptive tool. Reformers can assess feasibility (via H/V), identify intervention targets (via CLI), sequence reforms appropriately (structural then mechanistic), and predict success probability (via combined model). The 8,500-word paper establishes both the theoretical foundation and empirical validation for this integrated framework, providing a comprehensive guide for evidence-based institutional reform.
