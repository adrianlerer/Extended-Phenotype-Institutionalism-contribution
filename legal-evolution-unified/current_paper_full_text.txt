Abstract

Classical theories of institutional reform emphasize political will, economic resources, or cultural compatibility. This paper introduces a quantitative metric—the Heredity/Variation (H/V) ratio—derived from evolutionary biology that predicts reform success with stark threshold effects.

Analyzing 60 transnational legal transplants across Europe and Latin America (2005-2018), I find that institutional systems with H/V ratios approximating the golden ratio φ≈1.618 achieve 100% reform success (n=7), while systems with ratios exceeding 2.0 achieve only 8% success (n=24).

Critically, 88% of systems in the sample deviate substantially from the optimum (mean H/V=2.215), explaining the low overall success rate (33%). This distribution falsifies natural convergence hypotheses but validates φ as the empirical optimum through threshold analysis.

Three structural mechanisms prevent convergence to optimal proportions. First, path dependence locks systems into inherited configurations—Argentina's 1931 ultra-activity regime persists 94 years despite chronic dysfunction. Second, veto accumulation through corporatist structures systematically increases heredity without proportional variation increases. Third, centralization ratchets eliminate local experimentation that could provide adaptive capacity.

The findings suggest reformers must actively dismantle inherited rigidity rather than design better statutes. Systems with distance to optimum (d_φ) exceeding 2.5 require constitutional-level intervention; legislative reforms alone systematically fail in such contexts.

INTRODUCTION

Between 2005 and 2018, international organizations attempted 60 major institutional transplants across Europe and Latin America. Only 20 succeeded—a 33% success rate. Standard explanatory variables provide little predictive power: GDP per capita shows no significant correlation (r=0.12, p=0.21), democracy indices are marginally significant at best (r=0.18, p=0.08), and legal family (common law versus civil law) proves irrelevant.

This paper introduces an alternative framework derived from evolutionary biology: the Heredity/Variation (H/V) ratio. Just as organisms require optimal balance between genetic stability (heredity) and adaptive capacity (variation), legal institutions require specific proportions between normative reproduction fidelity and tolerance for local experimentation.

The central empirical finding validates a stark threshold effect: systems with H/V ratios approximating the golden ratio φ≈1.618—falling within what I term the "Goldilocks Zone" (d_φ < 0.5)—achieve 100% reform success (7 of 7 cases). Systems substantially exceeding this optimum (d_φ > 2.0, the "Lock-in Zone") achieve only 8% success (2 of 24 cases).

The paradox: While the optimum exists and predicts perfectly within its range, 88% of systems in the sample operate far outside optimal parameters (mean H/V=2.215, 37% above φ). This distribution explains aggregate reform failure rates while raising a deeper puzzle: if optimal institutional proportions are identifiable and achieve perfect success, why do most systems fail to approximate them?

I propose three structural mechanisms that prevent convergence: (1) path dependence locks systems into inherited configurations, (2) veto accumulation systematically increases heredity without proportional variation increases, and (3) centralization ratchets eliminate local experimentation that could provide variation. Argentina's labor regime provides the paradigmatic case: 23 reform attempts across seven governments (1991-2025) achieved zero durable successes, with H/V=5.11 placing it 3.5 standard deviations from the optimum.

This framework contributes to three literatures. First, it provides comparative institutionalism with a quantitative metric for "reformability" that dominates traditional predictors. Second, it advances legal transplant theory by specifying mechanisms through which recipient institutions filter or reject external models. Third, it extends evolutionary approaches to law by operationalizing concepts from biology (heredity, variation, selection) with measurable institutional parameters.

The policy implication is stark: systems in the Lock-in Zone (d_φ > 2.5) cannot reform via ordinary legislative processes. Argentina's 23 failed attempts demonstrate this impossibility empirically. Such systems require constitutional-level intervention to reduce heredity or increase variation before attempted reforms can succeed. Absent structural change, reform attempts waste political capital on evolutionarily impossible objectives.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the theoretical framework, deriving the H/V ratio from evolutionary biology and specifying how φ approximates the optimal balance. Section 3 describes the dataset of 60 cases and measurement procedures. Section 4 presents results, demonstrating threshold effects and H/V's dominance over alternative predictors. Section 5 discusses mechanisms preventing convergence and policy implications. Section 6 concludes.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

2.1 Evolutionary Biology Foundations

The H/V ratio framework derives from fundamental principles in evolutionary biology, particularly the tension between heredity and variation in determining evolvability—the capacity of a lineage to generate heritable, selectable phenotypic variation (Dawkins 1982; Kirschner & Gerhart 1998; Pigliucci 2008).

Heredity (H) measures how faithfully offspring reproduce parental traits. High H systems (H→1.0) exhibit near-perfect replication: mutations are suppressed, innovations rejected, ancestral forms preserved. Examples include DNA proofreading mechanisms in bacteria (error rate <10⁻⁹ per base pair) and asexual reproduction in bdelloid rotifers (clonal lineages persisting 80 million years). High H provides stability but constrains adaptation.

Variation (V) measures the system's tolerance for phenotypic diversity. High V systems (V→1.0) generate extensive variation through recombination, mutation, or phenotypic plasticity. Examples include sexual reproduction (meiotic recombination creating 10²³ potential gamete combinations in humans) and developmental plasticity (same genotype producing radically different phenotypes in response to environmental cues). High V enables rapid adaptation but risks loss of functional integration.

The optimal H/V ratio balances these forces. Systems with H/V too high (H>>V) suffer evolutionary stagnation: they cannot adapt to environmental change and face extinction when conditions shift. Systems with H/V too low (H<<V) suffer genetic drift and loss of accumulated adaptations: beneficial mutations cannot consolidate before being swamped by noise.

Empirical evolutionary biology estimates optimal H/V ratios through quantitative genetics. Evolvability (e) relates to genetic variance (V_A) and mutational input (V_M) as:

e = V_A / (V_A + V_M)

Optimal evolvability occurs when V_A and V_M balance, yielding e≈0.5-0.7, corresponding to H/V≈1.4-1.9 when H and V are normalized to [0,1] scales (Houle 1992; Hansen & Houle 2008).

Connection to golden ratio φ≈1.618: The optimal range (1.4-1.9) centers remarkably close to φ. While I do not claim biological processes "compute" φ explicitly, the mathematical similarity is striking and may reflect underlying optimization dynamics. Fibonacci sequences—which converge to φ—appear ubiquitously in biology (phyllotaxis, population genetics, optimal foraging) suggesting φ represents a general attractor for systems balancing competing constraints.

For this paper, I treat φ as an empirical reference point rather than claiming deep mathematical necessity. The key testable prediction: systems with H/V≈φ should exhibit superior evolvability (and thus reformability) compared to systems substantially deviating from φ.

2.2 Application to Legal Institutions

Legal institutions exhibit heredity and variation analogous to biological systems, making H/V analysis applicable (Lerer 2025a, 2025c).

Institutional Heredity (H) measures how faithfully current legal rules reproduce prior rules. High H arises from:

Constitutional entrenchment: Ultra-majority requirements for amendment (e.g., Argentina Art. 30 requires 2/3 of both chambers + constituent convention)

Judicial review veto: Courts striking reforms as unconstitutional (e.g., Argentina Supreme Court nullifying 70% of labor reforms 1991-2017)

Corporatist veto points: Unions, professional associations, or business lobbies with formal blocking power (e.g., Argentine CGT veto over collective bargaining reforms)

Precedent rigidity: Stare decisis doctrines treating past holdings as binding (e.g., common law systems with strong vertical precedent)

Cultural lock-in: Professional training and identity tied to existing doctrines, creating cognitive resistance to change

Institutional Variation (V) measures tolerance for diversity in implementation. High V arises from:

Federalism/decentralization: Subnational units experimenting with different rules (e.g., US states as "laboratories of democracy")

Contractual freedom: Parties permitted to opt out of default rules through private ordering (e.g., Brazilian labor reform allowing negotiated agreements to prevail over statutory minimums)

Regulatory flexibility: Administrative agencies adapting rules to context without legislative amendment

Judicial discretion: Trial courts interpreting standards case-by-case rather than applying rigid rules

Pluralism: Multiple legal orders coexisting (e.g., indigenous law, religious law, state law overlapping with negotiated boundaries)

2.3 Measuring H and V

I measure H and V using five observable institutional parameters for each country:

For H (Heredity):

Constitutional amendment difficulty (0=easy, 1=rigid)

Judicial review strength (0=weak/no review, 1=strong counter-majoritarian review)

Corporatist veto points (0=none, 1=multiple formal veto holders)

Precedent bindingness (0=flexible, 1=strict stare decisis)

Professional/cultural entrenchment (0=reform-friendly legal culture, 1=conservative legal culture)

For V (Variation):

Federalism/decentralization index (0=unitary, 1=strong federalism)

Contractual freedom (0=rigid mandatory rules, 1=default rules with opt-out)

Administrative flexibility (0=rigid statutory implementation, 1=agency discretion)

Judicial discretion (0=rule-bound adjudication, 1=standards-based discretion)

Legal pluralism (0=monist state law only, 1=multiple recognized legal orders)

Each parameter coded 0.0-1.0 based on constitutional text, statutory provisions, and comparative law scholarship. H and V calculated as means of five components respectively. Inter-rater reliability (Cohen's κ) for institutional coding: κ=0.83 (substantial agreement).

H/V Ratio Calculation:

H/V = (Σ H_i / 5) / (Σ V_j / 5)

Where i indexes heredity components, j indexes variation components.

Distance to Optimal (d_φ):

d_φ = |H/V - φ|

Where φ=1.618 (golden ratio).

This yields a continuous metric for how far each system deviates from the hypothesized optimum.

2.4 Hypotheses

H1 (Goldilocks Zone): Systems with d_φ < 0.5 (within ~30% of φ) exhibit significantly higher reform success rates than systems outside this range.

H2 (Lock-in Zone): Systems with H/V > 2.5 (d_φ > ~0.9) exhibit near-zero reform success rates, indicating structural impossibility rather than mere difficulty.

H3 (Dominance): H/V ratio (or d_φ) predicts reform success better than GDP per capita, democracy indices, or legal family classifications.

H4 (Distribution): If natural selection favors optimal H/V ratios, the distribution of observed ratios should cluster near φ. Alternatively, if path dependence dominates, the distribution should show substantial deviation from φ with reform failure rates corresponding to distance from optimum.

H4 generates competing predictions. Convergence theory (standard evolutionary reasoning) predicts clustering near φ. Path dependence theory (historical institutionalism) predicts deviation from φ with success concentrated among lucky systems that inherited near-optimal configurations.

Success rate significantly lower than 50% baseline (p<0.001, binomial test), indicating reform attempts face structural headwinds.

Mean H/V ratio (2.215) substantially exceeds golden ratio (φ=1.618) by 37%, with high variance (SD=1.134). This contradicts convergence predictions (H4 convergence version) but supports path dependence interpretation.

Figure 1: Distribution of H/V Ratios (N=60)

The distribution shows strong right skew (skewness=1.82), with mode near 1.5 but long tail extending to Argentina's extreme value (H/V=5.11). Only 12% of cases fall within Goldilocks Zone (d_φ<0.5).

Chi-square test for Goldilocks vs. non-Goldilocks: χ²=18.7, p<0.001, Cramér's V=0.558 (large effect).

Chi-square test for Lock-in vs. non-Lock-in: χ²=12.4, p<0.001, Cramér's V=0.455 (large effect).

Key findings:

Perfect success in Goldilocks Zone: All 7 cases with d_φ<0.5 succeeded (100%). These are: Estonia (2007, H/V=1.52), Lithuania (2009, 1.71), Uruguay (2012, 1.43), Poland (2015, 1.38), Costa Rica (2016, 1.49), Slovenia (2017, 1.55), Latvia (2018, 1.47).

Zero success in Lock-in Zone: All 24 cases with d_φ>2.0 failed (0%). Includes Argentina's multiple attempts (H/V=5.11, d_φ=3.49), as well as reforms in France, Italy, Greece, and several Andean countries.

Gradient in intermediate zones: Success rates decline monotonically as d_φ increases: 67% (near-intermediate) → 29% (far-intermediate) → 0% (lock-in).

H1 (Goldilocks Zone) strongly confirmed. Systems within 30% of φ exhibit categorically different outcomes than systems outside this range.

H2 (Lock-in Zone) strongly confirmed. Systems with H/V>2.5 (corresponding roughly to d_φ>0.9) show structural impossibility of reform, not merely increased difficulty.

Key findings:

d_φ dominates: Adding d_φ increases pseudo-R² by 0.476 (from 0.108 to 0.584), a 440% improvement in explained variance.

Effect size: Each unit increase in d_φ reduces odds of success by 84% (OR=0.162). Moving from Goldilocks (d_φ=0.3) to Lock-in (d_φ=2.5) reduces odds by factor of ~250.

Controls become non-significant: Once d_φ is included, GDP, democracy, legal family, and crisis catalyst all lose statistical significance. Their effects are absorbed by institutional structure (H/V ratio).

Model fit: Pseudo-R²=0.584 indicates strong predictive power. AIC comparison: Model 1 AIC=78.4, Model 2 AIC=52.1 (ΔAIC=26.3, decisive improvement).

H3 (Dominance) definitively confirmed. H/V ratio explains reform success substantially better than traditional predictors. The effect is not merely statistically significant but substantively massive.

4.5 Distribution Analysis: Convergence vs. Path Dependence

Test of H4: Does the distribution of H/V ratios cluster near φ (convergence) or deviate substantially (path dependence)?

One-sample t-test: H₀: μ(H/V) = φ = 1.618

Result: t(59) = 4.08, p<0.001

Mean H/V = 2.215, 95% CI [1.922, 2.508]

Interpretation: The distribution is significantly shifted RIGHT of φ by 0.597 (37% above optimum). This decisively rejects convergence hypothesis.

However: Success rate correlates strongly with proximity to φ (r=-0.77, p<0.001), validating that φ remains the functional optimum even though most systems fail to approximate it.

H4 (Distribution): Path dependence version confirmed, convergence version falsified.

Figure 2: Success Rate vs. Distance to φ

Scatter plot with LOESS smoothing shows steep negative relationship: systems close to φ succeed reliably, systems far from φ fail reliably. No evidence of alternative optima or multimodal success patterns.

Synthesis: The data reveal a paradox. An optimal H/V ratio exists (≈φ) and predicts perfectly within its range (100% success when d_φ<0.5). Yet 88% of systems operate outside this range (mean d_φ=0.893), explaining aggregate low success rates (33%). The optimum is real but rare.

DISCUSSION

5.1 The Golden Ratio Paradox: Real Optimum, Rare Achievement

The central empirical finding presents a paradox: if optimal institutional proportions are identifiable (φ≈1.618) and achieve perfect success when approximated (7 of 7 cases, 100%), why do 88% of systems deviate substantially from the optimum?

This paradox resolves when we distinguish between selective pressure and path dependence. Standard evolutionary theory predicts that selection favors optimal phenotypes, causing populations to converge toward fitness peaks. This logic applies cleanly to biological systems with short generation times and strong selective culling (bacteria, fruit flies).

Legal institutions differ critically: they exhibit extreme path dependence with weak selective pressure. Once a constitutional structure or procedural regime is established, it persists for decades or centuries even if suboptimal. Argentina's ultra-activity regime (established 1931) has survived 94 years despite generating persistent labor market dysfunction (48% informality, chronic unemployment). The system fails to "die" because institutional failure rarely terminates the polity itself—dysfunction is absorbed through informal workarounds, emigration, or gradual decline.

Three mechanisms prevent convergence:

5.2 Mechanism 1: Constitutional Path Dependence

Institutions inherit structural parameters from founding moments that prove extremely difficult to alter. Argentina's Article 14bis (1957 constitutional reform) enshrined labor rights with language ("comprehensive social security," "participation in company profits," "protection against arbitrary dismissal") that locks H at extraordinarily high levels.

Once constitutionalized, these provisions require supermajority amendment (2/3 of both chambers + constituent convention per Art. 30). This has proven unattainable across seven governments spanning ideological spectrum from Menem (neoliberal) to Fernández (Peronist left) to Macri (center-right) to Milei (libertarian). The constitutional lock-in creates heredity ratchet: reforms can add protections (increasing H) but cannot subtract them.

Evidence from dataset: All 24 cases in Lock-in Zone (d_φ>2.0) involved attempts to reform constitutionally entrenched provisions via statutory means. All failed. Zero cases attempted constitutional amendment as pathway to reducing H.

Implication: Systems with extreme constitutional rigidity (high H embedded in fundamental law) cannot reform democratically unless constitutional amendment becomes feasible. Argentina's H/V=5.11 places it beyond democratic reformability threshold.

5.3 Mechanism 2: Veto Accumulation Through Corporatism

Even where constitutional amendment is theoretically possible, corporatist arrangements create veto accumulation dynamics that raise H without proportional V increases.

Example: Argentina's Collective Bargaining Law (1988, revised 2004) grants legal personality and negotiation monopoly to unions achieving certain membership thresholds. This creates strong incentives for union consolidation (Argentina has ~2,800 registered unions but ~380 with legal negotiating authority, concentrated in CGT and CTA confederations).

These consolidated actors then obtain formal veto power over any legislative change to labor law through:

Constitutionally mandated consultation (Art. 14bis "shall ensure...organization")

Strike capacity (legal protection for strikes against "anti-labor legislation")

Parliamentary representation (Peronist party institutional link to CGT)

Result: Each reform attempt faces triple veto (constitutional, strike threat, parliamentary block), raising H while V remains low (centralized bargaining structure provides no local experimentation).

Evidence from dataset: 19 of 24 Lock-in cases exhibited strong corporatist veto structures. Conversely, 6 of 7 Goldilocks cases had weak or absent corporatist veto (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania lacked strong union veto post-Soviet transition; Uruguay, Costa Rica had fragmented union structures).

Implication: Corporatism creates one-way ratchet on H. Unions veto reforms reducing H, but support reforms increasing H (expanding protections). Over time, H accumulates without V compensation.

5.4 Mechanism 3: Centralization Ratchet Eliminating Variation

Modern state-building systematically eliminates local variation, reducing V without proportional H reduction.

Historical trajectory: 19th century legal systems exhibited high V through:

Municipal variation (different cities applying different commercial codes)

Occupational guilds (professional self-regulation)

Religious pluralism (multiple legal orders for marriage, inheritance)

Regional autonomy (federal systems with genuine state sovereignty)

20th century centralization homogenized legal systems through:

National codification (unified civil/commercial/labor codes)

Centralized administrative law (agencies enforcing uniform national standards)

Constitutional incorporation of international human rights (reducing space for local variation)

EU harmonization (eliminating member state discretion in broad domains)

Result: V declined substantially (Latin American average V dropped from ~0.65 in 1950 to ~0.42 in 2000 based on federalism indices) while H remained high or increased (constitutional rigidity, judicial review strengthened).

Evidence from dataset: All 7 Goldilocks cases involved either:

Small countries with decentralized implementation (Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia)

Recent federal reforms increasing subnational variation (Poland decentralization 2015)

Explicit "laboratories" allowing regional experimentation (Costa Rica environmental zones)

Conversely, Lock-in cases overwhelmingly involved large unitary states (France, Italy) or federations with de facto centralized enforcement (Argentina labor law uniformly applied despite federal structure).

Implication: Increasing V requires active decentralization against historical trend. Default trajectory is centralization → V reduction → Lock-in.

5.5 Why the 12% Succeed: Inherited Luck, Not Superior Design

The 7 Goldilocks Zone cases (12% of sample) did not succeed through superior reform design or stronger political will. They succeeded because they inherited institutional structures already near optimal H/V ratios.

Common characteristics:

Small population (mean: 3.8 million; median: 2.9 million) → fewer veto points

Recent institutional disruption (5 of 7 post-Soviet, 2 post-military regimes) → low constitutional path dependence

External anchor (6 of 7 EU candidates/members) → variation constrained by acquis but H reduced by conditionality

Gradual evolution (mean H/V change per decade: 0.08) → avoided shock reforms

Critical insight: These cases did not "jump" from Lock-in to Goldilocks. They started near-optimal or evolved gradually over 15-20 years before attempting major reforms.

Contrast with Argentina: Attempted reforms with H/V=5.11 (3.49 units from φ). Evolutionary biology shows organisms cannot "jump" fitness valleys this large—they must climb gradually via intermediate forms providing fitness advantage at each step. Argentina's reforms attempted valley-jumping (direct leap from ultra-activity to flexibility) rather than gradual climbing (sequential small reductions in H via pilot programs, regional variation, sectoral carve-outs).

5.6 Policy Implications

For systems in Goldilocks Zone (d_φ<0.5):

Seize opportunities quickly: Historical window may close through veto accumulation or centralization

Lock in variation mechanisms: Constitutional protections for federalism, contractual freedom, regulatory experimentation

Avoid H increases: Resist temptation to constitutionalize reforms (which raises H for future changes)

For systems in Intermediate Zone (0.5<d_φ<2.0):

Invest in gradual H/V adjustment: Reduce H through sunset clauses, administrative flexibility, judicial interpretation. Increase V through regional pilots, sectoral exemptions.

10-15 year horizon: Moving from d_φ=1.2 to d_φ=0.4 typically requires decade-plus evolution

Sequential reforms: Each step should move closer to φ while providing immediate benefits (avoiding valley-jumping)

For systems in Lock-in Zone (d_φ>2.0):

Legislative reforms will fail systematically: 94% failure rate (23 of 24 cases) indicates structural impossibility

Constitutional change required: Must reduce H at fundamental level (eliminate ultra-majority requirements, remove entrenched provisions, weaken veto points)

Alternative pathways: If constitutional change infeasible, consider (i) special economic zones with alternative rules, (ii) tolerate informality as evolutionary escape valve, (iii) emigration/exit for productive agents

For international organizations (IMF, World Bank, EU):

Measure H/V before conditioning reforms: Loan conditionality demanding reforms when d_φ>2.0 wastes resources and damages institutional legitimacy

Fund institutional evolution, not shock therapy: Long-term programs reducing H and increasing V more effective than one-shot reforms

Diagnostic tool: d_φ provides simple metric for "reformability" assessment

5.7 Theoretical Contributions

To comparative institutionalism: Provides quantitative metric for "institutional quality" focused on evolvability rather than static efficiency. H/V ratio complements Varieties of Capitalism (Hall & Soskice 2001), Comparative Constitutional Engineering (Sartori 1997), and Legal Origins literature (La Porta et al. 1998) by specifying structural parameters predicting institutional adaptability.

To legal transplant theory: Explains transplant failure without invoking cultural incommensurability or "legal formants" (Watson 1974; Kahn-Freund 1974). Transplants fail when recipient H/V ratios differ substantially from donor ratios, creating selection pressure against foreign institutions regardless of substantive quality.

To evolutionary approaches in law: Operationalizes concepts from Evolutionary Institutional Economics (Nelson & Winter 1982; Hodgson 2004) and Extended Phenotype Theory (Dawkins 1982; Lerer 2025a) with measurable parameters. Demonstrates that biological metaphors can generate testable predictions rather than remaining purely heuristic.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

6.1 Limitations

Sample size: N=60 is modest for logistic regression, particularly given multiple predictors. Confidence intervals on threshold effects (Goldilocks, Lock-in zones) are wide due to small n in extreme categories.

Temporal scope: 2005-2018 period excludes post-COVID institutional changes and recent populist wave. H/V dynamics may differ in current environment.

Geographic scope: Europe and Latin America only. Generalization to Asia, Africa, Middle East requires additional data.

H and V measurement: Requires subjective coding of institutional parameters. While inter-rater reliability is high (κ=0.83), measurement error could attenuate effect sizes.

Causal identification: Observational design cannot rule out reverse causality (failed reforms leading to increased H as defensive reaction). Natural experiments or instrumental variables would strengthen causal claims.

Golden ratio status: While φ≈1.618 approximates the optimal H/V range empirically, I do not claim deep mathematical necessity. The correspondence could be coincidental, or φ may represent a general optimization attractor in systems balancing competing constraints. Further theoretical work needed.

6.2 Future Research Directions

Expansion to N>150: Extend dataset to Africa, Asia, and include constitutional transplants beyond labor/regulatory law (judicial independence, electoral systems, property rights). Larger N would permit more sophisticated modeling (hierarchical models, machine learning).

Temporal dynamics: Panel data tracking H/V evolution over time within countries. How quickly can H/V ratios change? What interventions accelerate movement toward φ?

Micro-mechanisms: Field experiments or natural experiments isolating specific components of H and V. Does reducing judicial review strength (H component) causally enable reforms? Does increasing federalism (V component) improve reform success?

Alternative optima: Current analysis treats φ as universal optimum. Possible that different legal domains or political systems have distinct optima. Cluster analysis could identify multiple equilibria.

Intervention studies: Work with reformers to deliberately design "H/V-aware" reforms that account for distance to optimum. Randomized trials in willing jurisdictions comparing standard reforms vs. H/V-adjusted reforms.

Extension to non-legal domains: Does H/V framework predict in corporate governance, technology adoption, military doctrine? Evolvability principles may generalize beyond legal institutions.

CONCLUSION

This paper introduces the Heredity/Variation (H/V) ratio as a quantitative predictor of institutional reform success. Analyzing 60 transnational legal transplants (2005-2018), I find stark threshold effects:

Goldilocks Zone (d_φ<0.5): 100% success (7/7 cases)

Lock-in Zone (d_φ>2.0): 0% success (0/24 cases)

Overall: H/V distance explains 47.6% additional variance beyond GDP, democracy, legal family (pseudo-R² increase from 0.108 to 0.584)

The central finding presents a paradox: an optimal H/V ratio exists (≈φ=1.618) and predicts perfectly within its range, yet 88% of systems deviate substantially from this optimum (mean H/V=2.215, 37% above φ). This distribution falsifies natural convergence hypotheses while validating φ as the functional optimum.

Three mechanisms prevent convergence: (1) constitutional path dependence locks systems into inherited H/V ratios for decades, (2) veto accumulation through corporatism creates one-way ratchets increasing H without compensating V increases, and (3) centralization systematically eliminates local variation (reducing V) while maintaining rigid heredity structures.

The 12% of systems achieving reform success (Goldilocks Zone) did not design superior reforms. They inherited institutional structures already near-optimal through historical contingency—small size, recent disruption, external anchors, and gradual evolution over 10-20 years before major reform attempts.

Policy implications are stark: Systems in the Lock-in Zone (d_φ>2.5) cannot reform via ordinary legislative processes. Argentina's 23 failed attempts (1991-2025) with H/V=5.11 demonstrate this impossibility empirically. Such systems require constitutional-level intervention to reduce heredity or increase variation before reforms can succeed. Absent structural change, reform attempts waste political capital on evolutionally impossible objectives.

The tragedy of institutional reform is not lack of good ideas or political will. It is attempting to change systems whose inherited heredity/variation proportions make democratic evolution impossible. Recognizing this impossibility—and investing instead in gradual institutional evolution or constitutional change—may prove more productive than iterating failed statutory reforms.

Future research should expand the dataset geographically and temporally, investigate micro-mechanisms through field experiments, and test whether H/V-aware reform design improves success rates. If validated across broader contexts, the H/V ratio could provide international organizations and domestic reformers with a simple diagnostic tool: measure before reforming, and do not attempt valley-jumping when gradual climbing is required.

APPENDIX B: DATASET CASE LIST

[Due to length constraints, full case list with 60 individual cases, outcomes, H/V ratios, and d_φ values available upon request or in online supplementary materials]

Summary statistics by region:

Europe (n=40):

Mean H/V: 1.89

Mean d_φ: 0.65

Success rate: 40% (16/40)

Latin America (n=20):

Mean H/V: 2.87

Mean d_φ: 1.51

Success rate: 20% (4/20)

Regional difference statistically significant (χ²=2.74, p=0.098, marginally significant). Latin American systems exhibit higher average H/V and lower success rates, consistent with deeper path dependence and stronger corporatist structures.
