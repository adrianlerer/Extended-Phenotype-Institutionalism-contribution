# Paper 2: Resolving Kelsen's Paradox Through Evolutionary Biology

## Extended Abstract (500 words)

For nearly a century, Hans Kelsen's *Pure Theory of Law* has dominated legal philosophy through its rigorous separation of law from morality, politics, and sociology. Yet Kelsen himself acknowledged a fundamental paradox at the heart of his system: the problem of the *Grundnorm* (basic norm). 

Every legal norm derives its validity from a higher norm in Kelsen's hierarchical structure. Constitutional provisions validate statutes, statutes validate regulations, and so forth. But this regress must terminate somewhere. Kelsen posited the Grundnorm—a presupposed, non-positive norm that commands obedience to the constitution—as the ultimate foundation of legal validity. Crucially, Kelsen admitted this norm is neither enacted nor justified; it is simply **presupposed as a transcendental condition** for legal thought.

This "solution" has generated 80 years of philosophical debate without resolution. Hart criticized it as a "verbal maneuver," Raz questioned its necessity, and Alexy attempted procedural alternatives. All failed to resolve the core problem: **Where does the normative force of the Grundnorm itself come from?**

This paper presents an empirical resolution to Kelsen's paradox using Extended Phenotype Theory (EPT) from evolutionary biology. Our central thesis: **The Grundnorm is not presupposed—it is evolutionarily inherited.**

Drawing on converging evidence from four independent disciplines—primatology, archaeology, developmental psychology, and neuroscience—we demonstrate that normative cognition predates linguistic articulation by millions of years. Chimpanzees enforce proto-norms without language (Riedl et al. 2012), Paleolithic humans practiced normative exclusion 25,000 years before agriculture (Pettitt 2013), human infants display fairness intuitions before acquiring deontic vocabulary (Hamann et al. 2011), and neural circuits for norm processing evolved before language-specialized cortical regions (Moll et al. 2008).

These findings refute Kelsen's implicit assumption that normativity requires linguistic articulation. Instead, we propose that the "presupposed" Grundnorm reflects genetically and culturally inherited predispositions for norm-following that evolved through multilevel selection. Groups with proto-normative systems—mechanisms for detecting violations, punishing defectors, and rewarding cooperators—systematically outcompeted groups without such systems across the Pleistocene.

The normative "ought-feeling" that Kelsen described as presupposed is actually an **adaptive inheritance**, analogous to Chomsky's Universal Grammar. We do not "agree" to follow grammatical rules any more than we "agree" to follow the Grundnorm—both are inherited cognitive structures that enable coordination at scale.

This evolutionary resolution has profound implications for legal theory:

1. **Validity redefined**: Legal validity depends not on hierarchical derivation from a presupposed norm, but on memetic alignment with inherited proto-norms. This explains why some formally valid laws generate widespread "moral resistance" (they conflict with proto-norms like fairness or reciprocity).

2. **International law explained**: Treaties lacking enforcement mechanisms can nonetheless "feel binding" because they activate inherited norm-following predispositions, independent of sanction.

3. **Constitutional interpretation**: Constitutions that violate proto-normative principles (e.g., denial of reciprocity, extreme inequality) generate predictable patterns of non-compliance, regardless of formal validity.

4. **Legal transplants**: Why certain laws "fail to take root" in different cultures becomes explicable through gene-culture coevolution theory.

This paper does not commit the naturalistic fallacy. We are not deriving *ought* from *is*, but rather explaining the psychological origin of the *ought-feeling* that makes legal systems possible. The Grundnorm is real—but it is not presupposed. It is inherited.

## Competitive Positioning

### How This Paper Differs from Paper 1
- **Paper 1** (*Before the Command Was Spoken*): Establishes EPT framework with broad empirical evidence, demonstrates law's pre-linguistic origins
- **Paper 2** (this paper): **Targets specific philosophical problem** (Kelsen's Grundnorm), engages legal philosophy literature directly, offers formal resolution to regress problem

### Relationship to Existing Literature

#### Kelsen Scholarship
- **Unlike Paulson** (2013): We don't attempt internal repair of Pure Theory
- **Unlike Tur** (2002): We don't defend Grundnorm as coherent
- **Unlike Bindreiter** (2001): We don't reinterpret Grundnorm as pragmatic fiction
- **Instead**: We show Grundnorm reflects real inherited structure, not presupposition

#### Hart & Post-Hartian Positivism  
- **Unlike Hart**: We don't replace Grundnorm with social rule of recognition
- **Unlike Shapiro**: We don't ground validity in planning theory
- **Unlike Greenberg**: We don't ground validity in rational agency
- **Instead**: We ground validity in evolutionary adaptation

#### Natural Law Theory
- **Unlike Finnis**: We don't derive basic goods from practical reason
- **Unlike Murphy**: We don't defend theistic natural law
- **Unlike Aquinas-inspired theories**: We don't posit eternal law
- **Instead**: We show "natural" foundations are biological, not metaphysical

#### Evolutionary Jurisprudence (Existing)
- **Unlike Jones & Goldsmith** (2005): We don't just show evolution influences law
- **Unlike Kurland** (2011): We don't just apply game theory to legal rules
- **Unlike behavioral law & economics**: We don't just show biases affect legal reasoning
- **Instead**: We resolve specific theoretical problem (Grundnorm) using evolutionary evidence

## Key Definitions (To Be Established in Section 1)

### Grundnorm (Kelsen's Definition)
> "The basic norm is not created in a legal procedure by a law-creating organ. It is not—as a positive legal norm is—valid because it is created in a certain way by a legal act, but it is valid because it is presupposed to be valid" (Kelsen, *Pure Theory of Law*, 1967, p. 201).

### Extended Phenotype (Dawkins, 1982)
> "An animal's behavior tends to maximize the survival of the genes 'for' that behavior, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it" (Dawkins, *The Extended Phenotype*, p. 233).

### Proto-Norm (Our Definition)
> A behavioral regularity enforced through partner choice, coalition formation, or punishment that stabilizes cooperation in social groups, operating without linguistic articulation of deontic rules.

### Normative Inheritance (Our Definition)
> The transmission of predispositions for norm-detection, norm-following, and norm-enforcement through both genetic and cultural channels, shaped by multilevel selection across evolutionary time.

### Memetic Alignment (Our Definition)
> The degree to which a formally articulated legal norm (meme) corresponds to evolutionarily inherited proto-normative predispositions (genes + cultural transmission). High alignment → spontaneous compliance; Low alignment → resistance/enforcement problems.

## Methodological Approach

### Philosophical Component
- **Close reading** of Kelsen's primary texts (1934, 1945, 1960, 1967 editions)
- **Reconstruction** of the Grundnorm problem with formal precision
- **Survey** of 80 years of attempted resolutions (Hart, Raz, Alexy, etc.)
- **Demonstration** that all existing solutions presuppose what they aim to explain

### Empirical Component
- **Primatology**: Evidence of proto-normative enforcement without language
- **Archaeology**: Temporal precedence of normative exclusion before linguistic complexity
- **Developmental psychology**: Ontogenetic emergence of normativity before deontic language
- **Neuroscience**: Phylogenetic precedence of norm-processing circuits before language circuits

### Synthesis
- **Application** of Extended Phenotype Theory to explain all four evidence streams
- **Derivation** of testable predictions from EPT framework
- **Comparison** of EPT's explanatory power vs. existing philosophical theories

### Validation
- **Demonstrate** EPT explains anomalies that defeat competing theories:
  1. Why Grundnorm "feels" non-optional (evolutionary inheritance)
  2. Why certain formally valid laws face resistance (proto-norm violation)
  3. Why international law binds without sanctions (inherited norm-following)
  4. Why legal transplants fail predictably (memetic misalignment)
