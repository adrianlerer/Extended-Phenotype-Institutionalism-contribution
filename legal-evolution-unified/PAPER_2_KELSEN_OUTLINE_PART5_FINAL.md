# Paper 2: Objections Matrix and Writing Plan

## Detailed Objections/Responses Matrix

### Objection Category 1: Methodological

| Objection | Source | Our Response | Evidence to Deploy |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **"Naturalistic fallacy"** | Hume, Moore | Explaining ≠ justifying; we explain ought-feeling, not derive ought from is | Analogy to pareidolia (explaining face-detection ≠ justifying belief in cloud-faces) |
| **"Evolution explains impulses, not obligations"** | Metaethics (Street 2006) | Agree! We explain psychology of obligation, not normative force | Kelsen himself denied Grundnorm has justification |
| **"Neuroscience doesn't tell us what we ought to do"** | Contemporary philosophy | Correct—but explains WHY Grundnorm feels necessary (phenomenological puzzle) | fMRI studies (Moll et al. 2008) explain mechanism, not justification |
| **"Cross-species variation undermines universality"** | Comparative psychology | Proto-norms show universal STRUCTURE (reciprocity, punishment) with variable CONTENT | Universal Grammar analogy: Universal structure, variable word order |

### Objection Category 2: Theoretical (From Legal Philosophy)

| Objection | Source | Our Response | Evidence to Deploy |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **"Kelsen explicitly separated is/ought"** | Kelsen scholars | We accept distinction at level of justification, reject at level of explanation | Grammar has natural history (Chomsky) but isn't "merely factual" |
| **"This collapses law into biology"** | Legal positivists | No—EPT explains CAPACITY for law, not CONTENT of specific laws | Gene-culture coevolution: Universal capacity + cultural variation |
| **"Hart already naturalized with rule of recognition"** | Hartians | Hart's naturalism is shallow (doesn't explain internal point of view); ours is deep | Hart just defers problem; we ground internal point of view in inherited predisposition |
| **"This undermines normativity"** | General objection | Evolutionary origin doesn't undermine normativity any more than for language | We can reflect on/criticize inherited predispositions (like kin favoritism) |

### Objection Category 3: Empirical

| Objection | Source | Our Response | Evidence to Deploy |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **"Primate evidence is too sparse"** | Primatologists | Four independent species (chimps, bonobos, capuchins, humans) with convergent results | Riedl N=13, Leimgruber N=6, Surbeck N=6 communities, Hamann N=48 |
| **"Archaeological exclusion could be artifact"** | Archaeologists | 40-fold increase (0.67%→27%) across 3,902 burials is robust; χ²=11.89, p<0.001 | Pettitt (2013) controlled for taphonomic bias, cemetery size |
| **"Developmental timeline is unclear"** | Dev psychologists | Testable prediction: Intention-blind punishment age 2-3, intention-sensitive age 5-7 | Hamann (age 3 fairness), Choi (age 5-7 deontic language) |
| **"Neural evidence is correlational"** | Neuroscientists | Agreed—but phylogenetic PRIORITY of norm-circuits vs. language-circuits is causal claim | vmPFC (old) vs. Broca's area (recent); Insula (ancient mammalian structure) |

### Objection Category 4: Practical/Political

| Objection | Source | Our Response | Evidence to Deploy |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **"This justifies status quo"** | Progressive critics | No—EPT explains resistance to bad laws (proto-norm violation detection) | Civil rights movement activated dormant proto-norms (fairness, reciprocity) |
| **"This undermines legal reform"** | Reformers | Reform works BEST when activating proto-norms; EPT guides strategy | Example: Marriage equality appealed to fairness/reciprocity proto-norms |
| **"This makes law arbitrary"** | Anti-naturalists | Not arbitrary—constrained by adaptive function; only cooperation-stabilizing norms survived | Space of possible norms is narrow (reciprocity, fairness, proportionality universal) |
| **"This has dangerous political implications"** | General worry | Descriptive account ≠ prescriptive; understanding origins doesn't determine policy | Compare: Evolutionary psychology of violence doesn't justify violence |

### Objection Category 5: Kelsen-Specific

| Objection | Source | Our Response | Evidence to Deploy |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **"Kelsen's project was anti-naturalistic"** | Kelsen purists | Correct—but his anti-naturalism left Grundnorm unjustified; we solve his problem | Kelsen (1967, p. 201): Grundnorm "presupposed to be valid" (admits no justification) |
| **"Grundnorm is transcendental, not empirical"** | Neo-Kantians | If "transcendental" means "conditions for legal cognition," EPT provides empirical account of those conditions | Kant's categories also have evolutionary explanation (visual perception) |
| **"This confuses psychology with validity"** | Analytic philosophers | No—we explain psychology of validity-judgments; orthogonal to normative validity | Legal validity still requires memetic alignment (normative claim) |
| **"Kelsen would reject biological reductionism"** | Kelsen scholars | We're not reducing norms to biology; we're explaining capacity for norm-cognition | Analogous to explaining language capacity (Chomsky) without reducing meaning to biology |

## Rhetorical Strategy

### Opening Strategy: Establish Problem as Urgent
**Technique**: Start with concrete legal example (Supreme Court authority regress)
**Goal**: Show this isn't abstract philosophy—it's about legitimacy of law itself
**Avoid**: Dense philosophical jargon in first 2 pages

### Section 2 Strategy: Sympathetic Exposition of Kelsen
**Technique**: Quote Kelsen extensively, show evolution of his thinking across 40 years
**Goal**: Demonstrate we understand Kelsen better than critics who dismiss him
**Avoid**: Straw-manning Kelsen (he's actually quite sophisticated)

### Section 3 Strategy: Generous to Alternatives
**Technique**: Cite each alternative theory's strongest formulation, acknowledge insights
**Goal**: Show we've engaged alternatives fairly before rejecting them
**Avoid**: Dismissive tone (these are serious theories by brilliant philosophers)

### Section 4 Strategy: Make EPT Accessible
**Technique**: Use concrete examples (beaver dam, spider web) before abstract application
**Goal**: Legal philosophers may not know evolutionary biology—make it intuitive
**Avoid**: Assuming familiarity with extended phenotype concept

### Section 5 Strategy: Overwhelm with Convergent Evidence
**Technique**: Four independent disciplines, each sufficient alone, devastating together
**Goal**: Make empirical case undeniable (even if theoretical interpretation contested)
**Avoid**: Cherry-picking studies—acknowledge limitations honestly

### Section 6 Strategy: Show This Solves Kelsen's Exact Problem
**Technique**: Return to Kelsen's own words, show how EPT addresses his specific concerns
**Goal**: This isn't just "biological speculation"—it resolves Kelsen's paradox
**Avoid**: Drifting from Kelsen to general evolutionary ethics (stay focused)

### Section 7 Strategy: Demonstrate Practical Payoff
**Technique**: Show how EPT explains puzzles in contemporary legal theory
**Goal**: Not just historical interest—active implications for current debates
**Avoid**: Over-claiming (we don't solve ALL legal theory problems)

### Section 8 Strategy: Preemptive Defense
**Technique**: Anticipate objections, state them more forcefully than critics would
**Goal**: Show we've thought through implications, not naive about challenges
**Avoid**: Defensive tone (confidence that EPT survives scrutiny)

### Conclusion Strategy: Invitation to Research Program
**Technique**: Frame as beginning of new agenda, not final word
**Goal**: Invite collaboration, not declare victory
**Avoid**: Triumphalist tone (Kelsen scholars won't be convinced by arrogance)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: "This has been done before"
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive literature search for evolutionary approaches to Grundnorm
**Contingency**: If similar work exists, frame as "complementary" and emphasize novel evidence

### Risk 2: "Empirical evidence is too thin"
**Mitigation**: Four independent evidence streams provide redundancy
**Contingency**: If one stream criticized, other three still support thesis

### Risk 3: "Kelsen scholars reject biological approach on principle"
**Mitigation**: Frame as solving Kelsen's problem on his own terms (presupposition → inheritance)
**Contingency**: Target journals with interdisciplinary audience

### Risk 4: "Reviewers demand neurosciencedevelopmental/archaeological expertise we lack"
**Mitigation**: Co-author with empirical specialist
**Contingency**: Revise to emphasize convergence across fields (no single expertise needed)

### Risk 5: "Argument too long for journal article"
**Mitigation**: Target journals that publish long-form (Legal Theory publishes 80+ pages)
**Contingency**: Split into Paper 2A (problem) and Paper 2B (solution)
