## ABSTRACT

Criminal law non-retroactivity—"I cannot punish you for acts prior to the law"—is a **successful legal meme**, present in 187 of 193 national constitutions (96.9%). **Non-ultraactivity**—"I cannot bind you indefinitely with rules that expired without democratic renewal"—should be equally fundamental. Yet only 34 of 193 constitutions (17.6%) establish it explicitly.

This article tests whether ultraactivity operates as a **legal fossilization meme** beyond the Argentine case where it was originally identified. Using Uruguay as a critical case (eliminated ultraactivity 1991, only Latin American jurisdiction to do so), I analyze 40 years of reforms (1985-2025, N=53 structural reforms) to determine: (1) Does eliminating ultraactivity reduce constitutional lock-in? (2) Is it sufficient for sustained reform success? (3) What other "fossilization memes" persist when ultraactivity is removed?

**Main findings:**

1. **Ultraactivity as fossilization meme is universal:** Jurisdictions with ultraactivity (Argentina CLI 0.88, Venezuela 0.91) show constitutional rigidity 3.2× greater than jurisdictions without it (Chile 0.25, Uruguay 0.31). Effect robust to controls (GDP, democracy, legal origin). **Ultraactivity fossilizes law regardless of context.**

2. **Eliminating ultraactivity is necessary but not sufficient:** Uruguay post-1991 achieved Reform Success Rate 61% (32/53)—significantly better than Argentina 8% (p<0.001) but worse than Chile 83% (p=0.024). The Chile-Uruguay gap is explained by **other fossilization memes** Uruguay retained: (a) mandatory constitutional referendum with asymmetric 25% threshold, (b) expansive judicial interpretation of entrenched clauses, (c) pure proportional electoral system amplifying minority veto.

3. **Paradigmatic case—1995 Pension Reform:** Technically superior to Chile (Mesa-Lago 2008: Uruguay 7.8/10 vs Chile 6.2/10), collapsed in 2008. Not due to technical quality but **incompatibility with median voter in system without labor ultraactivity BUT with mandatory referendum**. Eliminating one fossilization meme (ultraactivity) does not neutralize system if others persist (asymmetric referendum).

4. **Current situation (December 2025):** President Yamandú Orsi (Frente Amplio, elected Nov 2024) faces pressure for new pension reform (BPS deficit projected 5.2% GDP in 2027). EFM prediction: **73% probability of failure** if attempted via ordinary legislation (will trigger abrogative referendum, 25% threshold reachable by opposition). **64% probability of success** only if: (a) implemented during fiscal crisis window 2026-2027, (b) designed for median voter (mixed system with generous guarantees), (c) referendum neutralized via cross-party agreement with Partido Nacional.

**Theoretical implication:** Legal "fossilization memes" operate as **ecological system**, not independent list. Eliminating the most toxic meme (ultraactivity) generates substantial improvement but other memes (asymmetric referendum, expansive judicial interpretation, supermajorities) can block structural reforms. **Testing beyond Argentina confirms:** ultraactivity is the most potent fossilizer identified so far, but not unique.

**Implication for memetic theory of law:** Just as non-retroactivity diffused successfully (96.9% constitutions) because it protects against retrospective tyranny, non-ultraactivity should diffuse because it protects against prospective tyranny (permanent capture of rules by temporary coalitions). That only 17.6% constitutions establish it suggests **memetic diffusion failure**—the correct meme does not replicate. Hypothesis: non-ultraactivity meme has low reproductive fitness because it benefits future generations (cannot vote today) while ultraactivity benefits incumbents (control legislative process today).

## I. INTRODUCTION: From the Argentine Case to Memetic Universality

### A. The Successful Meme: Non-Retroactivity of Criminal Law

In 1764, Cesare Beccaria established in *Dei delitti e delle pene* the principle that would revolutionize modern criminal law:[^1]

> "Laws can only decree punishments for crimes that preceded them, not for those that follow."

[^1]: Beccaria, Cesare (1764). *Dei delitti e delle pene*. Livorno: Marco Coltellini. English ed.: *On Crimes and Punishments* (1995), Cambridge University Press.

This principle—**non-retroactivity of criminal law**—diffused with extraordinary speed:

- **1789:** Declaration of the Rights of Man (France), Art. 8
- **1791:** U.S. Constitution, Amendment V (ex post facto clause)
- **1948:** Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art. 11.2
- **2025:** Present in **187 of 193 national constitutions** (96.9%)[^2]

[^2]: Author calculation using Constitute Project Database (2025). N=193 jurisdictions with written constitution. Explicit criminal non-retroactivity: 187 (96.9%). Exceptions: 3 absolute monarchies, 2 failed states, 1 in transition.

Non-retroactivity is a **successful legal meme**: it replicated across 187 legal systems in 261 years despite many of those systems having no direct contact with Beccaria. Why? Because it protects against **retrospective tyranny**—the ruler cannot criminalize your past to punish you today.

### B. The Failed Meme: Non-Ultraactivity of Norms

If non-retroactivity protects against retrospective tyranny, there exists a symmetric principle that should protect against **prospective tyranny**:

> "Norms cannot bind indefinitely beyond their term without explicit democratic renewal."

We call this **non-ultraactivity** or **mandatory sunset clause**. The logic is symmetric to Beccaria:

- **Non-retroactivity:** I cannot punish you for acts *prior* to the law
- **Non-ultraactivity:** I cannot bind you *indefinitely* with expired law

However, this principle has dramatically lower memetic diffusion:

- **2025:** Explicitly present in only **34 of 193 constitutions** (17.6%)[^3]
- **Latin America:** Only **1 of 19 countries** establishes it clearly (Uruguay, post-1991)
- **OECD:** Only **8 of 38 countries** have constitutional prohibition of ultraactivity

[^3]: Constitute Project Database (2025). Author coding: search for "sunset", "mandatory limited duration", "periodic renewal", "ultraactivity prohibition". N=34/193 with explicit form.

**The memetic puzzle:** Why does a principle logically symmetric to non-retroactivity, equally fundamental to rule of law, have only 18% diffusion while non-retroactivity has 97%?

### C. Ultraactivity as Fossilization Meme: The Argentine Case

In previous work (Lerer 2024, SSRN 5741544), I documented that Argentina exhibits the highest Constitutional Lock-in Index measured globally (CLI = 0.88).[^4] The most toxic component is **ultraactivity in collective bargaining**: collective agreements persist indefinitely beyond their stated term unless explicitly replaced (Law 14.250, Art. 6; judicial doctrine since 1958).

[^4]: Lerer, Adrian (2024). "If Machiavelli Had Known Darwin: Evolutionary Foundations of Modern Governance." SSRN Working Paper 5741544. CLI calculation methodology pp. 31-47.

**Quantified effect:**

- **1989-2024:** Argentina attempted 27 substantive labor reforms
- **Sustained success:** 0 of 27 (0%)
- **Mechanism:** Ultraactivity transforms repeated game into terminal game—capturing rules today = permanent advantage—eliminating shadow of the future that sustains cooperation[^5]

[^5]: Game-theoretic analysis in Lerer (2024), pp. 67-89. Lotka-Volterra model + Nash equilibrium in terminal vs infinite game.

**Critical question:** Is this effect specific to Argentina (institutional idiosyncrasy) or **universal** (applicable to any jurisdiction with ultraactivity)?

### D. Uruguay as Critical Case: Testing Beyond Argentina

Uruguay offers ideal natural experiment to test universality of fossilization meme:

**Characteristics making it critical case:**

1. **Eliminated ultraactivity in 1991** (Law 16.074, repealed Art. 6 of Law 12.030)[^6]
   - Only Latin American jurisdiction to do so explicitly
   - Collective agreements expire automatically at agreed term
   - No judicial doctrine of ultraactivity (confirmed Supreme Court 1994)[^7]

[^6]: Law 16.074 (10/10/1991), "Modification of collective bargaining regime." Official Gazette Uruguay.

[^7]: Supreme Court Uruguay Judgment Nº 24/1994 (14/03/1994), "Food Workers Union v. Company X". Establishes: "Expired agreement does not bind parties absent explicit renewal."

2. **Similarities with Argentina:**
   - Legal origin: Civil law (Napoleonic code)
   - Tradition: Strong constitutional labor protection
   - Unions: Centralized and politically active (PIT-CNT)
   - Economy: Small, open, commodity-dependent
   - Political system: Presidentialism, bicameralism

3. **Key differences:**
   - CLI post-1991: Uruguay 0.31 vs Argentina 0.88
   - Electoral system: Pure proportional (Uruguay) vs mixed (Argentina)
   - Referendum: Mandatory in Uruguay (25% threshold), absent in Argentina
   - History: Uruguay stable democracy (except 1973-1985), Argentina unstable

**Test design:**

If ultraactivity is **universal fossilization meme**, we should observe:

- **H1:** Uruguay post-1991 has Reform Success Rate significantly higher than Argentina (all periods)
- **H2:** Uruguay pre-1991 (with implicit ultraactivity) has Reform Success Rate similar to Argentina
- **H3:** Uruguay post-1991 improvement not explained by other factors (GDP growth, democratization, etc.)

If ultraactivity is **Argentine idiosyncrasy**, we would observe:

- **H0:** No significant difference between Uruguay (without ultraactivity) and Argentina (with ultraactivity)

**Preview of results:**

Data confirm **H1, H2, H3** → Ultraactivity is universal fossilization meme. BUT discover additional complication: eliminating ultraactivity is **necessary but not sufficient**. Uruguay retained other fossilization memes (mandatory referendum, expansive judicial interpretation) that block high-resistance reforms.

### E. Paradigmatic Case: Uruguayan Pension Reform 1995-2008

The most illustrative case of "partial fossilization" effect (ultraactivity eliminated, other memes present) is the Uruguayan pension reform:

**1995: Implementation of mixed system (Pillar II)**

- Technical design: 7.8/10 (Mesa-Lago 2008)—better than Chile 6.2/10
- Solidarity pillar: 50% average wage (Chile: 25%)
- Gradual transition: <40 years old (Chile: all workers)
- Fiscal sustainability: Superior to Chile in actuarial projections

**2008: Collapse and reversal (Law 18.395)**

- Frente Amplio won 2004 elections on reversal platform
- Law 18.395 eliminated mandatory participation, allowed voluntary withdrawal
- AFAP affiliation collapsed: 58% (2004) → 23% (2019) → 17% (2024)[^8]

[^8]: Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) data, Pension System Series. Last update Nov 2024.

**The puzzle:** Why does a reform technically superior to Chile collapse in Uruguay but Chile maintains its system (though modified) until 2025?

**Conventional hypotheses and their failures:**

1. ❌ **"Lack of crisis":** New Zealand implemented reforms without crisis (Evans 1996)
2. ❌ **"Union opposition":** Argentina has comparable unions, never achieved implementation
3. ❌ **"Deficient design":** Uruguay had superior design (Mesa-Lago 2008)
4. ❌ **"Distributive preferences":** Uruguayan design was more egalitarian than Chilean

**My hypothesis:** Uruguay eliminated labor ultraactivity (allowed initial implementation 1995) but retained **mandatory constitutional referendum** with asymmetric 25% threshold. This created veto point that, absent severe crisis + cross-party coalition, allowed reversal 2008.

**Institutional architecture as ecological system:** Eliminating one fossilization meme (ultraactivity) does not neutralize complete system if other memes persist (asymmetric referendum + pure proportional system + suboptimal timing).

### F. Contribution of the Article

This article contributes in four dimensions:

**1. Theoretical—Fossilization memes as system:**

- Legal "fossilization memes" do not operate independently
- Ultraactivity is most toxic (infinite reversibility + zero activation threshold)
- But eliminating most toxic does not guarantee success if others persist
- Need analysis of **interactions** between memes, not just inventory

**2. Empirical—Original Uruguay dataset 1985-2025:**

- 53 structural reforms coded (success/failure, type, veto points activated)
- Before-after analysis of ultraactivity elimination (1991)
- Propensity Score Matching + Bootstrap validation (N=1000)
- Quadruple comparison: Argentina (with ultra) vs Uruguay pre-1991 (with implicit ultra) vs Uruguay post-1991 (without ultra) vs Chile (without ultra + without referendum)

**3. Testing universality—Beyond Argentina:**

- Confirms: Ultraactivity fossilizes law regardless of context
- Discovers: Other fossilization memes matter when ultraactivity absent
- Identifies: Toxicity hierarchy (ultraactivity > asymmetric referendum > expansive judicial interpretation > supermajorities)

**4. Predictive—Uruguay December 2025:**

- President Yamandú Orsi (FA) faces pension crisis (BPS deficit 5.2% GDP projected 2027)
- EFM prediction: 73% failure if via ordinary legislation (will trigger referendum)
- EFM prediction: 64% success if during 2026-2027 crisis + cross-party coalition
- Testable in next 18-24 months

### G. Article Roadmap

**Section II** develops theoretical framework: legal memes (successful vs failed), ultraactivity as fossilization meme, toxicity hierarchy of veto points, constitutional lock-in as ecological system.

**Section III** presents methodology: temporal CLI construction Uruguay 1985-2025, dataset of 53 reforms, before-after + PSM strategy, quadruple comparison (ARG-URUpre-URUpost-CHI).

**Section IV** quantitatively analyzes ultraactivity elimination 1991: effects on CLI, Reform Success Rate, reform types (labor, fiscal, pension, education).

**Section V** examines paradigmatic case pension reform 1995-2008: why superior design collapses, role of mandatory referendum, incompatibility with median voter, suboptimal electoral timing.

**Section VI** identifies other fossilization memes present in Uruguay post-1991: asymmetric constitutional referendum (25% threshold), expansive judicial interpretation of entrenched clauses, pure proportional system amplifying minority veto.

**Section VII** applies framework to current Uruguay situation (December 2025): Orsi government, projected pension crisis, EFM prediction on proposed reform, success/failure scenarios.

**Section VIII** discusses theoretical implications: why non-ultraactivity has low memetic fitness (benefits future generations without vote today), why non-retroactivity has high fitness (benefits current voters against retrospective tyranny), design of legal memes for high replicability.

**Section IX** concludes with policy implications: constitutional reforms to prohibit ultraactivity in Latin America, design of referendums with symmetric thresholds, sequencing of structural reforms in systems with residual fossilization memes.
