## Author's Note on Citations

This reference list includes **essential sources only**—works that directly inform our theoretical framework, empirical methodology, or comparative context. We deliberately avoid citation inflation (the "fanfarrón" approach) common in some academic writing.

Three types of sources are included:

1. **Foundational theory** (Dawkins, Tsebelis, Acemoglu-Robinson): Establishes core concepts
2. **Comparative politics literature** (Lijphart, Iversen-Soskice, Mesa-Lago): Provides institutional context
3. **Methodological references** (Abadie et al., Angrist-Pischke): Documents technical approaches

Notable **omissions** (deliberately excluded despite relevance):
- Extensive Latin American country studies (would add 40+ citations without advancing argument)
- Every paper on veto players/reform (Tsebelis 2002 synthesizes this literature adequately)
- Multiple sources saying same thing (one authoritative cite suffices)

**Total: 20 references** for a ~27,000-word article is intentionally sparse by political science standards (typical ratio: 1 cite per 200-300 words would yield 90-135 references). We prefer **substance over citation count**.

For readers seeking deeper literature engagement, we recommend:
- **Veto players**: Start with Tsebelis (2002), then his *Annual Review of Political Science* (2000) article
- **Latin American reforms**: Huber & Stephens (2012) is the definitive synthesis
- **Electoral systems**: Lijphart (1999) remains the canonical reference after 25 years
