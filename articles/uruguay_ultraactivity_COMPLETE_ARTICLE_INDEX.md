**Abstract:** This article tests whether ultraactivity—the indefinite persistence of legal norms beyond their stated term—operates as a universal "fossilization meme" blocking institutional adaptation, or whether it is specific to Argentina. Using Uruguay's 1991 elimination of ultraactivity as a natural experiment, we find large causal effects (+34 to +42 percentage points increase in reform success). However, effect size is moderated by three factors: (1) other veto points (referendum, judicial review), (2) median voter position under proportional representation, and (3) crisis timing. The 1995 pension reform failure—technically superior yet referendum-defeated—illustrates that ultraactivity elimination is necessary but not sufficient. Four conditions must hold simultaneously for reform success: no ultraactivity, no other high-toxicity vetoes, median voter compatibility, and crisis window. This demanding conjunction explains why structural reforms fail most of the time, even in well-functioning democracies.

## NOTES FOR REVISION (If Needed)

**Potential expansions:**
- Add section on fiscal federalism (if reviewers request)
- Expand global comparison (currently 1 table, could add 3-4 pages)
- Include interview data (elite interviews with Uruguayan legislators)
- Add formal model of veto point substitution (game theory)

**Potential cuts:**
- Reduce case study length (currently 2,900 words, could trim to 2,000)
- Condense methodology (currently 4,200 words, could reduce to 3,500)
- Shorten current situation analysis (if APSR wants "purer" historical focus)

**Current length (27,000 words) is appropriate for:**
- ✓ SSRN (no length limit)
- ✓ AJPS (accepts long articles ~25-30k words)
- ≈ APSR (prefers 20-25k, but accepts up to 30k with editor permission)
- ✗ JOP (strict 12,000 word limit) - would require 50% cut

**Recommendation:** Submit to SSRN + AJPS simultaneously. If AJPS rejects, revise for APSR. JOP would require major restructuring.
