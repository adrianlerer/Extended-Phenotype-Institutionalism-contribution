# IusMorfos: A 12-Dimensional Framework for Analyzing Constitutional Change Without Amendment

**SSRN Working Paper - Abstract & Introduction**

---

## ABSTRACT

**The Puzzle**. Constitutional systems transform radically without formal amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned more precedents in 2020-2025 (nine explicit overrulings) than the previous fifteen years combined, reshaping abortion rights, administrative law, and affirmative action—yet no Article V amendment passed since 1992. Argentina's Supreme Court (CSJN) oscillates doctrinally every 8-12 years with each government change despite its 1994 constitutional reform. Why do some systems experience rapid unidirectional transformation while others endure chronic instability?

**Theory**. This paper introduces three integrated frameworks. **IusMorfos 12D** maps constitutional change across twelve dimensions (teleology, procedural legitimacy, memetic contestation, velocity, electoral capture, social movements, economic crises, elite cohesion, judicial review, text/doctrine, legitimation crisis, external shocks), revealing that constitutional transformation requires simultaneous multi-dimensional activation—what we term "fractal cases." **ESS (Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) Theory** explains why certain constitutional theories dominate through a fitness function: F(theory) = Legitimation × Recruitment × (1/Abandonment Cost). Originalism currently exhibits fitness of 0.43 (driven by Federalist Society institutional capture: 30% federal judiciary, 6/9 SCOTUS), while living constitutionalism languishes at 0.08 despite academic support. Pragmatism emerges as the true ESS (fitness 0.59) due to low switching costs enabling rapid adaptation. **RootFinder** identifies three institutional vulnerabilities enabling change without amendment: procedural (*Marbury* grants SCOTUS final interpretive authority), electoral (life tenure + narrow appointment process), and memetic (epistemic communities reinforce doctrinal shifts). Core finding: Constitutional theories don't constrain change—they serve elite projects of institutional capture.

**Empirics**. We analyze 47 SCOTUS decisions (2020-2025), 35 years of CSJN jurisprudence (1990-2025), and eight comparative cases (Chile 2022 constitutional rejection, Mexico 1994 judicial reform, FDR 1937 court-packing failure, Bork 1987 nomination defeat, Argentina 2020 judicial reform failure, Turkey 2010 constitutional referendum). Quantitative measures include: Elite Cohesion Index (ECI—U.S. 2024 = 0.58, Argentina 2024 = 0.34, Chile 2022 = 0.28), constitutional change velocity (Late Roberts Court = 3.20 changes/year vs. Warren Court = 1.25), and Resistance Score (RS—systems with RS ≥ 0.60 predict reform failure with 100% accuracy across five cases). Key finding: Systems with ECI < 0.50 experience chronic doctrinal instability; ECI > 0.70 predicts stability.

**Implications**. We propose institutional immunization mechanisms: staggered 18-year term limits (preventing single-administration Court capture), supermajority confirmation requirements (60% Senate threshold raising abandonment costs), and dimensional firebreaks (limiting simultaneous multi-dimensional change). Contra Sunstein & Vermeule's institutional fatalism, we demonstrate that capture is not inevitable if constitutional architecture incorporates evolutionary safeguards. Elite cohesion, not textual specificity or popular consensus, determines constitutional stability.

## I. INTRODUCTION

### The Vertigo of Constitutional Change

"Something is happening here, and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?" Bob Dylan's 1965 lyric captures the profound disorientation of constitutional transformation—the vertigo that grips legal systems when foundational premises shift beneath practitioners' feet.<sup>1</sup>

Consider the professional experience of a constitutional law professor teaching in 2019 versus 2025. In 2019, *Roe v. Wade* was settled law, reaffirmed by *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) and surviving multiple challenges for fifty years. *Chevron* deference was administrative law's bedrock, cited in over 18,000 federal court decisions. Affirmative action in higher education was permissible under narrow tailoring, validated by *Grutter v. Bollinger* (2003). By 2025, all three doctrinal pillars have collapsed: *Roe* overruled by *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), *Chevron* overruled by *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo* (2024), *Grutter* overruled by *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* (2023). One prominent constitutional law professor admitted to colleagues: "I can no longer teach my students to take this Court's doctrine seriously—the rules I trained them on no longer exist."<sup>2</sup>

This is what Saikrishna Prakash and Cass Sunstein call "constitutional vertigo"—the dizzying experience when "what many had thought was 'off the wall' is now 'on the wall,' and conventional wisdom has been turned upside down."<sup>3</sup> Yet constitutional vertigo is not unique to our current moment. It is a recurring feature of American constitutional history, and understanding its dynamics is essential for grasping how constitutional systems transform without formal amendment.

### The Puzzle of Constitutional Change Without Amendment

Radical constitutional change—massive shifts in constitutional understanding, doctrine, and practice—occurs periodically in American history. The New Deal Court (1935-1942) witnessed the collapse of economic liberty doctrine in just seven years, overruling *Lochner*-era precedents and inaugurating the modern administrative state. The Warren Court (1953-1969) achieved a civil rights revolution over sixteen years, transforming equal protection, criminal procedure, and fundamental rights jurisprudence. The Roberts Court (2020-2025) has presided over an originalist counter-revolution in five years, overruling nine explicit precedents and creating seven new doctrinal frameworks—a constitutional change velocity of **3.20 changes per year**, the highest since the New Deal.<sup>4</sup>

Yet remarkably, no Article V constitutional amendment has been ratified since 1992 (the 27th Amendment, originally proposed in 1789). The formal amendment process—requiring two-thirds of Congress and three-quarters of state legislatures—has become functionally inoperable in an era of partisan polarization.<sup>5</sup> How, then, does the Constitution "change" without changing?

The puzzle deepens when we examine comparative cases. Argentina's Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Nación, CSJN) experiences chronic doctrinal oscillation, shifting constitutional baselines every 8-12 years with each government turnover despite a comprehensive 1994 constitutional reform designed to enhance judicial independence.<sup>6</sup> Chile twice attempted constitutional refounding through democratic plebiscites—first rejecting a progressive 388-article draft in 2022 (61.9% "Rechazo"), then rejecting a moderate 132-article draft in 2023 (55.8% "Rechazo")—leaving the Pinochet-era 1980 Constitution intact.<sup>7</sup> Brazil's 1988 Constitution has been amended 111 times in 36 years, yet its Supreme Court (STF) exhibits relative doctrinal stability compared to Argentina.<sup>8</sup>

**Why do some constitutional systems experience rapid, unidirectional transformation (United States 2020-2025) while others oscillate chronically (Argentina) or resist change entirely (Chile)?** What determines whether constitutional change stabilizes into a new equilibrium or triggers perpetual instability? These are the central questions this paper addresses.

### Existing Literature: Three Paradigms

Constitutional scholarship offers three main approaches to understanding extra-textual constitutional change, each illuminating different aspects of the phenomenon but leaving critical gaps.

**Bruce Ackerman's Dualist Democracy** argues that constitutional change occurs through "constitutional moments"—periods of intense popular mobilization (Founding, Reconstruction, New Deal) when "We the People" exercise higher lawmaking authority outside Article V's formal amendment process.<sup>9</sup> Ackerman's framework elegantly explains regime-level transitions but struggles with incremental-yet-radical change: the Roberts Court's 2020-2025 transformation lacks mass popular mobilization (indeed, public opinion opposes many decisions), yet achieves comparable doctrinal magnitude to the New Deal.

**Jack Balkin's Living Originalism** introduces the "off-the-wall to on-the-wall" spectrum, describing how once-unthinkable constitutional arguments migrate toward mainstream plausibility through social movement mobilization and elite advocacy.<sup>10</sup> Balkin's framework captures memetic dynamics—how the Federalist Society normalized originalism from fringe theory (1980s) to judicial orthodoxy (2020s)—but lacks a formal model explaining *why* certain arguments successfully migrate while others remain perpetually off-the-wall. What selection mechanism determines constitutional argument fitness?

**Mark Tushnet's Constitutional Hardball** focuses on norm violations—political actors exploiting constitutional ambiguities to entrench partisan advantage (e.g., Mitch McConnell's 2016 blockade of Merrick Garland's nomination).<sup>11</sup> Tushnet identifies crucial tactical maneuvers but doesn't explain systemic conditions enabling hardball's success: why did McConnell's gambit work in 2016 but FDR's court-packing plan fail in 1937 despite stronger electoral mandate?

All three approaches focus on *how* constitutional change happens—through popular mobilization (Ackerman), argumentative evolution (Balkin), or norm erosion (Tushnet). None answer *why* certain changes succeed while others fail, nor do they integrate: (1) **dimensional analysis** (identifying where in the constitutional system change occurs), (2) **evolutionary dynamics** (explaining why certain constitutional theories outcompete others), or (3) **comparative perspective** (explaining divergent trajectories across similar institutional structures). The United States and Argentina both have: presidential systems, federal structures, independent judiciaries with constitutional review, and life-tenured supreme court justices. Yet the U.S. experiences rapid transformation while Argentina oscillates chaotically. Why?

### This Paper: Three Integrated Frameworks

We introduce three theoretical frameworks that, taken together, provide a comprehensive account of constitutional change without amendment.

#### IusMorfos 12D: Mapping Constitutional Systems as Multi-Dimensional Spaces

Constitutional systems operate across twelve dimensions simultaneously: **D1 (Teleology)**, the normative justification for constitutional order; **D2 (Procedural Legitimacy)**, the lawfulness of change mechanisms; **D3 (Memetic Contestation)**, competition for interpretive dominance; **D4 (Velocity)**, the speed of doctrinal transformation; **D5 (Electoral Capture)**, control over appointment processes; **D6 (Social Movements)**, bottom-up mobilization pressures; **D7 (Economic Crises)**, material conditions enabling/constraining change; **D8 (Elite Cohesion)**, unity among governing coalitions; **D9 (Judicial Review)**, scope of constitutional interpretation authority; **D10 (Text/Doctrine)**, written constitutional provisions and judge-made doctrines; **D11 (Legitimation Crisis)**, public confidence in constitutional institutions; **D12 (External Shocks)**, wars, pandemics, or transnational pressures.

Constitutional change requires simultaneous multi-dimensional activation. A change in D5 (Electoral Capture) alone is insufficient—it must combine with D4 (Velocity), D8 (Elite Cohesion), and D3 (Memetic Contestation) to produce stable transformation. We term cases activating 8+ dimensions simultaneously **"fractal cases"**—decisions whose micro-level holdings trigger macro-level systemic effects. *Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022) is paradigmatic: it activated 11/12 dimensions, from D1 (teleological shift toward fetal personhood) to D11 (legitimation crisis evidenced by 60% public disapproval).<sup>12</sup>

The framework's key insight: **constitutional stability depends on dimensional interaction patterns, not textual specificity**. Systems maintaining equilibrium across dimensions resist destabilization; systems experiencing dimensional asynchrony (e.g., rapid D5 change without corresponding D8 cohesion) oscillate chaotically.

#### ESS Theory: Constitutional Theories as Competing Strategies

Why does originalism dominate American constitutional discourse in 2025 while living constitutionalism, despite comparable intellectual sophistication and academic support, remains marginal? We apply **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) theory** from evolutionary game theory to model constitutional theories as competing strategies in a memetic environment.

A constitutional theory's **fitness** depends on three factors:

**F(theory) = Legitimation × Recruitment × (1 / Abandonment Cost)**

- **Legitimation (L)**: Elite acceptance of theory as normatively valid (0-1 scale). Measured via judicial citation frequency, elite organization membership (Federalist Society vs. American Constitution Society), and academic hiring patterns.
  
- **Recruitment (R)**: Proportion of judicial actors adhering to theory (0-1 scale). Measured via federal judiciary composition and Supreme Court membership.
  
- **Abandonment Cost (C)**: Reputational/institutional penalties for switching theories (0-1 scale). Measured via case studies of "switcher" justices (e.g., Justice Souter's abandonment of originalism triggered the "No More Souters" movement within conservative legal circles, raising future abandonment costs to 0.85).

Applying this model to contemporary U.S. constitutional theories:

| Theory | Legitimation (L) | Recruitment (R) | Abandonment Cost (C) | Fitness (F) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Originalism** | 0.65 | 0.42 | 0.63 | **0.43** |
| **Living Constitutionalism** | 0.33 | 0.17 | 0.70 | **0.08** |
| **Pragmatism** | 0.47 | 0.40 | 0.32 | **0.59** |

Originalism's current dominance (fitness 0.43) stems not from philosophical superiority but from **institutional capture**: the Federalist Society controls 30% of the federal judiciary and 6/9 Supreme Court seats, creating high recruitment (R = 0.42) and high abandonment costs (C = 0.63, meaning judges face significant reputational penalties for defecting).<sup>13</sup> Living constitutionalism exhibits low fitness (0.08) due to weak institutional infrastructure—the American Constitution Society, founded in 2001, lags two decades behind the Federalist Society's 1982 inception and achieves only 7% federal judiciary penetration.

Surprisingly, **pragmatism emerges as the true ESS** (fitness 0.59) due to low abandonment cost (C = 0.32)—judges can adopt pragmatic reasoning without ideological commitment, enabling rapid adaptation to changing circumstances. This explains Chief Justice Roberts' jurisprudence: nominally originalist yet pragmatically institutionalist in key moments (*NFIB v. Sebelius* 2012, *King v. Burwell* 2015).

The critical insight: **constitutional theories don't constrain judicial behavior—they legitimate post-hoc elite preferences**. Originalism doesn't cause the Roberts Court's conservatism; rather, conservative legal elites weaponized originalism as a vehicle for institutional capture after identifying judicial appointments as the least democratically accountable path to policy change.

#### RootFinder: Three Institutional Vulnerabilities Enabling Change

Why can the U.S. Supreme Court transform constitutional law without amendment while the German Federal Constitutional Court cannot? We identify three **institutional roots** that, when present simultaneously, enable constitutional change without formal amendment:

1. **Procedural Root**: *Marbury v. Madison* (1803) established judicial supremacy—the Court possesses final interpretive authority over constitutional meaning, unreviewable by coordinate branches. Germany's Basic Law Article 79(3) enshrines an "eternity clause" immunizing core constitutional commitments (human dignity, democracy, federalism) from amendment or interpretation, constraining judicial discretion.<sup>14</sup>

2. **Electoral Root**: Life tenure + narrow appointment process (presidential nomination + Senate confirmation) concentrates constitutional change authority in a handful of appointment moments. A single two-term presidency capturing 3-4 Supreme Court seats can reshape constitutional law for a generation. Germany's Federal Constitutional Court uses staggered 12-year non-renewable terms, preventing single-administration capture.

3. **Memetic Root**: Epistemic communities (legal academia, elite bar associations, ideological legal networks like Federalist Society/ACS) generate and reinforce constitutional theories, creating feedback loops between judicial appointments and doctrinal evolution. Once a theory achieves recruitment threshold (R > 0.35), it becomes self-reinforcing through citation networks and clerkship pipelines.

The United States possesses all three roots simultaneously, rendering it vulnerable to rapid constitutional change without amendment. Argentina possesses procedural and electoral roots but lacks memetic infrastructure (weak legal academia, underdeveloped constitutional theory), producing oscillation rather than stable transformation. Chile's constitutional convention (2021-2022) attempted to create new procedural and memetic roots simultaneously via popular constituent power, but fractured elite cohesion (ECI = 0.28) prevented consolidation.

### Roadmap

Part II develops the three theoretical frameworks in detail, specifying operational definitions for each dimension, fitness function parameters, and institutional root conditions. Part III presents empirical analysis: 47 Roberts Court decisions (2020-2025), 35 years of Argentine CSJN jurisprudence (1990-2025), and eight comparative case studies (Chile 2022 constitutional rejection, Mexico 1994 SCJN reform, FDR 1937 court-packing failure, Bork 1987 nomination defeat, Argentina 2020 judicial reform failure, Turkey 2010 constitutional referendum, Germany 1949-2025 stability, Hungary 2010-2025 autocratization). Part IV proposes institutional reforms: staggered 18-year term limits, supermajority confirmation thresholds (60% Senate), dimensional firebreaks limiting simultaneous multi-dimensional change, and elite cohesion monitoring mechanisms. Part V discusses implications for constitutional theory and comparative institutional design.

**Our central claim**: Constitutional stability depends on institutional design incorporating evolutionary safeguards, not on textual specificity, popular consensus, or normative constitutional theories. Elite cohesion (ECI > 0.70), dimensional equilibrium, and institutional immunization mechanisms determine whether constitutional systems experience stable transformation, chronic oscillation, or catastrophic collapse. Contra Sunstein & Vermeule's institutional fatalism—the view that interpretive methods inevitably serve elite preferences regardless of institutional design—we demonstrate that **capture is not inevitable if constitutional architecture builds in evolutionary resistance**.<sup>15</sup> The Roberts Court's current trajectory is a product of specific design failures (life tenure, narrow appointment process, absence of dimensional firebreaks), not an inherent feature of constitutional systems. Other designs are possible, and we conclude by sketching their contours.
