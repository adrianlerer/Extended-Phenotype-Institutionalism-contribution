**Correlation**: VERY STRONG negative pattern

**Key Patterns**:
- **Israel**: Moderate CSI, moderate-high REI (democracy with security constraints, but institutional resilience)
- **Turkey**: Very high CSI, very low REI (authoritarian drift post-2016, judiciary captured)
- **Egypt**: Extremely high CSI, extremely low REI (military authoritarianism, complete institutional capture)

**Regional Insight**: Middle East shows strongest CSI-REI correlation so far. Authoritarian systems combine high orthodoxy with reform failure.

**Democracy Correlation**: Israel (democracy) = lower CSI/higher REI; Turkey/Egypt (authoritarian) = higher CSI/lower REI.

**Time Investment**: ~8 hours (3 jurisdictions × 3 domains)
