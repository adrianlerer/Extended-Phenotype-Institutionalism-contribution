## Published Papers

### Paper 1: Before the Command Was Spoken
**Full Title**: *Before the Command Was Spoken: Law as the Extended Phenotype of Pre-Linguistic Norms*

**Author**: Ignacio Adrián Lerer

**Publication Date**: November 2025

**SSRN Link**: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5695662

**Abstract**: 
Law is not a human invention *ex nihilo*, but the extended phenotype of pre-linguistic normative patterns that evolved to stabilize cooperation in early human groups. Drawing on Extended Phenotype Theory (Dawkins 1982) and converging evidence from primatology, archaeology, developmental psychology, and neuroscience, this paper demonstrates that proto-normative systems evolved millions of years before humans developed linguistic capacity to articulate deontic rules.

**Keywords**: extended phenotype, proto-normativity, legal evolution, primatology, archaeology, third-party punishment, deontic modality

**Length**: 15,000+ words

**Target Audience**: Evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, legal theorists

### Paper 2: The Grundnorm as Evolutionary Inheritance
**Full Title**: *The Grundnorm as Evolutionary Inheritance: Resolving Kelsen's Paradox Through Extended Phenotype Theory*

**Author**: Ignacio Adrián Lerer

**Publication Date**: November 2025

**SSRN Link**: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5696484

**Abstract**:
For nearly a century, Hans Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law has dominated legal philosophy through its rigorous separation of law from morality, politics, and sociology. Yet Kelsen acknowledged a fundamental paradox: every legal norm derives validity from a higher norm, but this hierarchical regress must terminate somewhere. Kelsen's solution—the Grundnorm (basic norm), presupposed but unjustified—has generated 80 years of philosophical debate without resolution.

This paper presents an empirical resolution using Extended Phenotype Theory from evolutionary biology. The Grundnorm is not a transcendental presupposition but an evolutionary inheritance: normative cognition predates linguistic articulation by millions of years. Evidence from primatology (0% third-party punishment in chimpanzees vs. 25.7% in capuchins), archaeology (0.67% → 27% normative exclusion markers across 35,000 years), developmental psychology (fairness intuitions at age 3, before deontic language), and neuroscience (vmPFC norm-processing circuits predate Broca's area) converges on a single conclusion—proto-normative systems evolved before deontic language.

**Keywords**: Hans Kelsen, Grundnorm, evolutionary jurisprudence, Extended Phenotype Theory, multilevel selection, proto-norms, legal validity

**Length**: 14,467 words

**Target Audience**: Legal philosophers, Kelsen scholars, analytical jurisprudence community

**Target Journals**: *Legal Theory* (Cambridge), *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, *Oxford Journal of Legal Studies*

## Companion Paper Strategy

These two papers are **companion works** that strengthen each other:

**Paper 1**: Establishes Extended Phenotype Theory framework with broad empirical evidence
- Target audience: Evolutionary scientists, anthropologists, archaeologists
- Shows: Law has pre-linguistic origins
- Evidence: Cross-species comparative data, archaeological record, developmental psychology

**Paper 2**: Uses EPT to solve specific foundational problem in legal philosophy (Kelsen's Grundnorm)
- Target audience: Legal philosophers, jurisprudence scholars
- Shows: Resolves 100-year-old philosophical paradox empirically
- Evidence: Same 4 disciplines + formal evolutionary model + legal applications

**Cross-citation strategy**: Each paper references the other, creating mutually reinforcing argument
