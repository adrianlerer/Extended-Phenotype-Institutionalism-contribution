## ABSTRACT

Political narratives with obvious logical inconsistencies often persist and triumph over coherent alternatives. Argentine obras sociales (labor union health insurance schemes) exhibit massive fragmentation and inefficiency yet have survived 55 years across dictatorships and democracies. The aguinaldo (mandatory 13th-month salary) explicitly increases formal labor costs while purporting to promote employment. In international law, simplistic sovereignty narratives defeat technically sophisticated globalist arguments despite interdependence realities. Why do "irrational" narratives exhibit superior memetic fitness?

This paper develops a costly signaling framework adapted from evolutionary biology (Zahavi's handicap principle) to explain this paradox. I argue that logical inconsistencies are not bugs but features—they function as filters for differential selection by credulity. Like the "Nigerian prince scam" which maintains absurdity to pre-select gullible recipients and minimize costly follow-up with skeptics, populist narratives incorporate obvious inconsistencies to filter adherents who prioritize tribal loyalty over epistemic rigor. This maximizes return on investment in political mobilization.

I formalize this mechanism through a utility function where propagators optimize U = (P_conversion × Gain) - (C_filtration + C_followup), deriving optimal "absurdity level" C* as a function of population credulity distribution θ and follow-up costs. Empirical validation uses two datasets: (1) 60 transnational legal conflicts (2000-2025) coded for narrative complexity versus institutional success, and (2) Argentine policy history (1946-2025) tracking survival rates by sophistication level.

Results confirm strong negative correlation between narrative sophistication and institutional persistence (r = -0.67, p<0.001). Policies with "apparent inefficiency" exhibit 2.3x higher survival rates (Cox proportional hazards). Institutions with complexity score C≤2 show 100% survival after 80 years versus 8% for C≥7 after 3 years. Base mobilization mediates 59% of this effect, consistent with filtering theory. The 216:1 reproductive advantage of populist over liberal memes in Argentina (Lerer 2025) reflects optimized filtering architecture rather than voter irrationality.

Implications: Effective institutional reform requires incorporating selection filters, not just technical rationality. I derive prescriptive rules for designing competitive reformist memes (target C=2-4, construct clear enemies, prioritize symbols over explanations). Ethical tensions between political efficacy and epistemic honesty are discussed. This framework bridges evolutionary biology, behavioral economics, and institutional analysis, offering predictive tools for policy design and narrative competition.
