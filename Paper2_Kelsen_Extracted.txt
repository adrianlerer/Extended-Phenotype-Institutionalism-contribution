Abstract
For nearly a century, Hans Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law has dominated legal philosophy through its rigorous separation of law from morality, politics, and sociology. Yet Kelsen acknowledged a fundamental paradox: every legal norm derives validity from a higher norm, but this hierarchical regress must terminate somewhere. Kelsen's solution—the Grundnorm (basic norm), presupposed but unjustified—has generated 80 years of philosophical debate without resolution. Hart criticized it as circular, Raz questioned its necessity, and successive theorists have attempted repairs that ultimately presuppose what they aim to explain.
This paper presents an empirical resolution using Extended Phenotype Theory from evolutionary biology. The Grundnorm is not a transcendental presupposition but an evolutionary inheritance: normative cognition predates linguistic articulation by millions of years. Evidence from primatology (0% third-party punishment in chimpanzees vs. 25.7% in capuchins), archaeology (0.67% → 27% normative exclusion markers across 35,000 years), developmental psychology (fairness intuitions at age 3, before deontic language), and neuroscience (vmPFC norm-processing circuits predate Broca's area) converges on a single conclusion—proto-normative systems evolved before deontic language.
The normative "ought-feeling" reflects genetically and culturally inherited predispositions shaped by multilevel selection. Groups with proto-normative enforcement outcompeted groups without. Modern legal systems scaffold these inherited capacities but do not create normativity ex nihilo.
This explains puzzling phenomena: why formally valid laws face systematic resistance (proto-norm violation), why international law binds without robust enforcement (inherited norm-following), and why legal transplants fail predictably (memetic misalignment). The Grundnorm is not presupposed—it is inherited.

I. Introduction: The Regress Problem
1.1 Legal Authority and Its Foundation
Consider a familiar scene in American constitutional law. The Supreme Court strikes down a federal statute, citing Article III of the Constitution as authority. A litigant challenges this authority. The Court responds: the Constitution itself grants the power of judicial review. But what validates the Constitution's authority to grant such powers?
The standard answer invokes "We the People"—the Constitution derives authority from popular sovereignty. But this simply restarts the question: what makes popular sovereignty a source of legal authority? One might appeal to democratic theory, natural rights, or social contract—but each answer requires normative premises that themselves demand justification.
This is the problem of infinite regress in legal validity, and it has haunted legal philosophy since Austin. Every attempt to ground legal authority leads either to circular reasoning (the Constitution validates itself) or to an infinite chain of justifications (A validates B, B validates C, C validates D...). Hans Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law represents the most sophisticated attempt to resolve this paradox—and his failure to do so exposes a fundamental gap in our understanding of law's normative force.
1.2 Kelsen's Solution: The Grundnorm
Kelsen's answer was architecturally elegant. He proposed that legal norms form a hierarchical structure (Stufenbau), with each norm deriving validity from a higher norm. Constitutional provisions validate statutes, statutes validate regulations, regulations validate administrative decisions. But to prevent infinite regress, Kelsen posited a Grundnorm—a "basic norm" that sits atop the hierarchy and validates the constitution without itself requiring validation from a higher norm.
Crucially, Kelsen insisted the Grundnorm is neither enacted nor justified. It is simply presupposed as a "transcendental-logical" condition for legal cognition:
"The basic norm is not created in a legal procedure by a law-creating organ. It is not—as a positive legal norm is—valid because it is created in a certain way by a legal act, but it is valid because it is presupposed to be valid" (Kelsen 1967, 201).
For Kelsen, asking "why presuppose the Grundnorm?" commits a category error. We presuppose it because legal thought is impossible without it, just as (in Kant's framework) we presuppose causality because experience is impossible without it. The Grundnorm is a condition of possibility for law, not a conclusion derived from law.
1.3 The Paradox Persists
Yet this "solution" has satisfied almost no one. H.L.A. Hart called it a "needless shuffle" (Hart 1961, 292). Joseph Raz argued it is redundant if purely formal (Raz 1979, 127-128). Robert Alexy attempted to replace it with discourse theory (Alexy 1992). Ronald Dworkin dissolved the problem by rejecting fact-value separation (Dworkin 1986). Natural law theorists invoked divine will or practical reason. Each response, however, presupposes normative commitments somewhere:
Hart's rule of recognition: Why accept officials' "internal point of view" as normatively binding?
Raz's exclusionary reasons: Why accept authority's claim to provide reasons?
Alexy's discourse norms: Why accept rational discourse procedures as binding?
Dworkin's integrity: Why value interpreting law in its "best light"?
Finnis's basic goods: Why recognize these goods as self-evident?
Every philosophical repair smuggles normativity through a conceptual backdoor. The regress continues.
1.4 An Empirical Alternative
This paper proposes a radically different resolution: the Grundnorm is not presupposed—it is evolutionarily inherited. The normative "ought-feeling" Kelsen identified is not a transcendental presupposition but a biological and cultural inheritance shaped by millions of years of selection for cooperative behavior.
Drawing on Extended Phenotype Theory (Dawkins 1982) and converging evidence from four independent disciplines, we demonstrate:
Primatology: Proto-normative enforcement (punishment of defectors, coalition-based suppression of dominance) operates in non-human primates without linguistic articulation of rules
Archaeology: Normative exclusion markers (deliberate burial denial) appear 25,000 years before evidence of complex deontic language
Developmental Psychology: Human infants display fairness intuitions and third-party punishment at age 3, before acquiring deontic modal vocabulary ("must," "ought")
Neuroscience: Neural circuits processing normative violations (vmPFC, TPJ) are phylogenetically older than language-specialized regions (Broca's area, Wernicke's area)
These findings refute Kelsen's implicit assumption that normativity requires linguistic articulation. Instead, the Grundnorm reflects genetically and culturally inherited predispositions for norm-detection, norm-following, and norm-enforcement—predispositions that evolved through multilevel selection as groups with proto-normative systems outcompeted groups without them.
We do not "presuppose" the Grundnorm any more than we "presuppose" Universal Grammar (Chomsky 1965). Both are inherited cognitive structures enabling coordination at scale. The difference: grammar governs syntax; proto-norms govern cooperation.
1.5 Theoretical Stakes
This evolutionary resolution has profound implications for legal philosophy:
First, it redefines legal validity. Validity depends not on hierarchical derivation from a presupposed norm but on memetic alignment with inherited proto-norms. This explains why some formally valid laws generate widespread resistance—they violate proto-normative principles like fairness, reciprocity, or proportionality.
Second, it explains international law's binding force. Treaties lacking robust enforcement can nonetheless "feel binding" because they activate inherited norm-following predispositions independent of sanction.
Third, it predicts legal transplant success. Constitutions violating proto-normative principles (extreme inequality, denial of reciprocity) generate predictable non-compliance patterns regardless of formal validity.
Fourth, it integrates law and biology without committing the naturalistic fallacy. We do not derive ought from is; we explain the psychological origin of the ought-feeling that makes legal systems possible.
1.6 Roadmap
Part II reconstructs Kelsen's Pure Theory and demonstrates why philosophical repairs fail. Part III introduces Extended Phenotype Theory and its application to norms. Part IV presents converging empirical evidence from four disciplines. Part V develops formal model showing proto-Grundnorm emergence as evolutionarily stable strategy. Part VI applies framework to three constitutional anomalies. Part VII addresses objections. Part VIII concludes with implications for legal philosophy.
II. The Pure Theory and Its Discontents
2.1 Kelsen's Core Commitments
Hans Kelsen's Reine Rechtslehre (Pure Theory of Law) aimed to establish jurisprudence as a science by purifying it of political ideology, moral philosophy, and sociological description (Kelsen 1934, 1960/1967). Five commitments structure his system:
1. Methodological Dualism: Law belongs to the realm of Sollen (ought), not Sein (is). Legal propositions describe norms, not facts. Confusing these categories—the is/ought fallacy—invalidates jurisprudence.
2. Normativity: A legal norm is a "ought-statement" (Sollsatz) expressing that certain conduct ought to occur. Validity is a specifically normative concept, not reducible to efficacy, morality, or social acceptance.
3. Hierarchical Structure: Legal norms form a pyramid (Stufenbau). Constitutional norms stand atop, followed by statutes, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative acts. Each lower norm derives validity from a higher norm authorizing its creation.
4. Dynamic System: Unlike moral systems (where norms derive from static principles), legal systems are dynamic-norms are valid because they were created according to procedures specified by higher norms, regardless of content.
5. The Grundnorm: To avoid infinite regress, the hierarchy terminates in a basic norm that is presupposed, not posited. For a given legal system, the Grundnorm has the form: "One ought to obey the commands of the historically first constitution and the norms created thereunder."
This architecture generates Kelsen's famous doctrine: a norm is legally valid if and only if it was created in accordance with a higher valid norm, tracing ultimately to the presupposed Grundnorm.
2.2 The Grundnorm in Detail
Kelsen's Grundnorm is not a positive legal norm—it is never enacted, never appears in legal texts, and cannot be changed through legal procedures. Nor is it a moral norm—its content is not derived from ethical principles but simply presupposes the validity of a particular constitutional order.
What, then, is it? Kelsen's answer evolved across three phases:
2.2.1 Neo-Kantian Phase (1911-1920s)
In Hauptprobleme der Staatsrechtslehre (1911), Kelsen characterized the Grundnorm as a "transcendental-logical presupposition" analogous to Kant's categories of understanding. Just as we must presuppose causality to have experience, we must presuppose the Grundnorm to have legal cognition:
"The basic norm is the condition for the possibility of the validity of all norms belonging to one and the same legal order" (Kelsen 1911, translated in Paulson 1992, 171).
In this phase, the Grundnorm is an epistemological necessity: without presupposing it, we cannot interpret human acts as legal acts. A piece of paper with ink marks becomes a "statute" only if we presuppose norms authorizing the statute's creation.
Problem: Why presuppose this Grundnorm rather than another? Kelsen had no answer beyond "because we want to cognize this order as legal."
2.2.2 Dynamic Phase (1930s-1950s)
In the first edition of Reine Rechtslehre (1934) and General Theory of Law and State (1945), Kelsen emphasized the Grundnorm's function in a dynamic legal system. The Grundnorm is a "hypothetical norm" that validates the historically first constitution:
"If we ask why the constitution is valid, perhaps we come upon an older constitution. Ultimately we reach some constitution that is the first historically... Its validity cannot be derived from a higher norm; the presupposition of its validity is the ultimate presupposition, the final postulate, upon which the validity of all the norms of our legal order depends" (Kelsen 1945, 115-116).
Here the Grundnorm is foundational rather than epistemological: it doesn't just enable legal cognition—it grounds legal validity itself.
Problem: This makes the Grundnorm sound like a posited norm (it validates other norms), yet Kelsen insists it's not posited. The tension between "presupposition" and "foundation" remains unresolved.
2.2.3 Fictional Phase (1960s)
In the second edition of Reine Rechtslehre (1960, translated 1967), Kelsen invoked Hans Vaihinger's philosophy of "as if" (Philosophie des Als Ob). The Grundnorm is a fiction in Vaihinger's sense—something we treat as if it were valid, knowing it's not actually valid:
"The Basic Norm is not valid because it has been created in a certain way, but its validity is presupposed, and it is presupposed because without this presupposition no human act could be interpreted as a legal act" (Kelsen 1967, 201).
"The Basic Norm of a legal order is the postulated ultimate rule according to which the norms of this order are established and annulled, receive and lose their validity... It is a fiction in the sense of Vaihinger's philosophy of 'As If'" (Kelsen 1967, 217n).
Problem: If the Grundnorm is a fiction (known to be false), how does it ground genuine normativity? Vaihinger's fictions are useful falsehoods—but normative force seems to require something more robust than a convenient pretense.
2.3 Hart's Critique: The Social Rule Alternative
H.L.A. Hart's Concept of Law (1961) offered the most influential critique of Kelsen's Grundnorm. Hart argued that the infinite regress problem is an illusion generated by confusing two types of rules:
Primary rules: Rules imposing obligations (e.g., "Don't steal")
Secondary rules: Rules about rules (e.g., rules for creating, modifying, or adjudicating primary rules)
In Hart's account, every legal system contains a "rule of recognition"—a secondary rule specifying criteria for identifying valid law (e.g., "Whatever Parliament enacts is law"). Crucially, the rule of recognition is not itself valid or invalid; it simply exists as a social practice:
"The rule of recognition exists only as a complex, but normally concordant, practice of the courts, officials, and private persons in identifying the law by reference to certain criteria. Its existence is a matter of fact" (Hart 1961, 107-110).
Hart claimed this dissolves Kelsen's regress problem. We don't need a Grundnorm to validate the rule of recognition because rules of recognition aren't the kind of thing that require validation—they're social facts.
Kelsen's response (in later writings) pointed out that Hart's solution merely postpones the problem. If the rule of recognition is just a social fact (people accept it), then law reduces to sociology—violating the separation between Sein and Sollen. Moreover, even if officials accept a rule of recognition, why ought we follow what officials accept? Unless acceptance itself generates normativity, Hart has explained legal practice but not legal obligation.
The deeper problem: Hart's "internal point of view"—the perspective of someone who accepts the rule—presupposes normative commitment. But where does this commitment come from? Hart treats it as a brute fact ("some people just do accept rules"), but this leaves the normative force of law unexplained.
2.4 Raz's Exclusionary Reasons
Joseph Raz attempted to ground legal authority in rational agency rather than social facts (Raz 1975, 1979, 1985). His "service conception of authority" holds that:
"The exercise of authority is justified if it helps the subjects better comply with reasons which apply to them" (Raz 1979, 28).
Legitimate authority provides exclusionary reasons—reasons not to act on one's own judgment about what reasons apply. If the law commands X, I have a reason to do X and a reason not to act on my own assessment of whether X is worth doing.
Raz's move is subtle: he doesn't ground law in morality (Kelsen's taboo), but in practical rationality. Accepting legal authority can be rational if authorities are better positioned than I am to determine what I have reason to do.
Problem: This presumes I already have "reasons which apply to me" independent of authority. But where do those reasons come from? If they're moral reasons, Raz has violated Kelsen's separation of law and morality. If they're prudential reasons (self-interest), law reduces to power. If they're rational requirements, we need an account of what makes something a rational requirement—and the regress returns.
Moreover, even if I grant that accepting authority helps me comply with pre-existing reasons, why ought I comply with those reasons? Raz has explained when authority is rational, but not why it's obligatory. The normative gap remains.
2.5 Alexy's Discourse Theory
Robert Alexy attempted a procedural solution inspired by Habermas (Alexy 1989, 1992). Law claims correctness—every legal decision implicitly claims to be correct, not merely valid. Correctness, in turn, requires justifiability through rational discourse under ideal conditions.
Alexy's key move: legal validity has two dimensions:
Formal validity: Conformity with authorized procedures
Material validity: Compatibility with principles justified through rational discourse
The Grundnorm is replaced by discourse rules—procedural norms governing rational argumentation (e.g., no participant may be prevented from entering discourse, every participant may question any assertion).
Problem: Why are discourse rules themselves binding? Alexy says they're "transcendental-pragmatic" conditions for meaningful discourse—anyone engaging in discourse must presuppose them. But this is just Kelsen's move repackaged: discourse rules are presupposed as conditions for rational argument, just as the Grundnorm was presupposed as a condition for legal cognition.
Moreover, ideal discourse conditions never obtain in reality. Actual legal discourse occurs under power asymmetries, information constraints, and time pressures. If validity depends on ideal discourse, almost no actual law is valid-a reductio ad absurdum.
Finally, even if discourse norms are pragmatically necessary, pragmatic necessity doesn't generate normative force. Chess players must presuppose chess rules to play chess, but this doesn't mean they ought to play chess. Similarly, legal arguers must presuppose discourse norms to argue legally, but why ought they engage in legal argument at all?
2.6 Dworkin's Constructive Interpretation
Ronald Dworkin's Law's Empire (1986) rejected Kelsen's fact-value distinction entirely. For Dworkin, law is an "interpretive concept"—legal practice is best understood as an attempt to show existing legal materials in their "best light," where "best" is determined by fit with past decisions and substantive political morality.
Dworkin's key claim: asking "what is law?" is like asking "what is courtesy?" Both are interpretive concepts where we construct the concept through practice. There's no external standpoint from which to validate our construction—validation is internal to the practice of interpretation itself.
Legal validity, then, depends on integrity—the virtue of treating like cases alike and interpreting the legal system as expressing a coherent set of principles. Integrity is foundational, not derived from a higher norm.
Problem: Why is integrity a value? Dworkin simply asserts it, offering analogies to personal integrity and community. But these analogies presuppose we already value integrity in those domains. Why ought we value integrity at all?
Moreover, Dworkin's "constructive interpretation" requires interpreters to have antecedent moral and political commitments to determine what counts as "best light." But where do those commitments come from? If they're subjective preferences, interpretation collapses into ideology. If they're objective moral truths, Dworkin owes us a meta-ethics—and the regress continues at the moral level.
Finally, even if integrity is valuable, why does it obligate? I might agree that interpreting law with integrity is aesthetically pleasing or intellectually satisfying, but this doesn't explain why I'm bound to follow law interpreted that way. Dworkin has explained legal reasoning but not legal obligation.
2.7 Natural Law Responses
Natural law theorists reject the entire Kelsenian project, denying that law can be separated from morality. Three prominent versions:
2.7.1 Finnis's Practical Reason
John Finnis argues that legal obligation derives from "basic goods"—values known through practical reason as intrinsically worthwhile (life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability, practical reasonableness, religion). Legal systems serve these basic goods; legitimate law helps us realize them (Finnis 1980).
Problem: Why are these basic goods? Finnis says they're self-evident to practical reason. But this just asserts what needs explanation. Different people find different things self-evident. Why should I accept Finnis's list rather than Nietzsche's (power), Bentham's (pleasure), or Rand's (self-interest)?
Moreover, even granting basic goods exist, why does their existence obligate me? The naturalistic fallacy looms: from "X is good," it doesn't follow that "I ought to pursue X" without additional normative premises. Finnis has described goods, not explained obligation.
2.7.2 Fuller's Procedural Natural Law
Lon Fuller argued that law has an "internal morality"—procedural constraints any legal system must satisfy to function (generality, publicity, clarity, non-contradiction, possibility of compliance, stability, congruence between rules and official action) (Fuller 1964).
Problem: These are conditions for efficacy, not validity. A legal system that violates Fuller's principles will malfunction, but this doesn't mean its rules lack legal force—they're just bad rules. Fuller has identified pragmatic constraints, not normative foundations.
Moreover, why value the rule of law (Fuller's implicit commitment)? Fuller can't answer without circularity: we value rule of law because it enables law to function—but this presumes law should function, which is precisely what needs justification.
2.7.3 Theistic Natural Law (Aquinas)
Classical natural law (Aquinas, Suárez) grounds legal obligation in divine will. Eternal law (God's plan for creation) generates natural law (rational creatures' participation in eternal law), which in turn constrains human law. Legal obligation derives ultimately from duty to obey God.
Problem in secular context: This requires theology, unavailable in pluralistic societies. Separation of church and state precludes grounding legal obligation in religious duties.
Problem even granting theism: The Euthyphro dilemma applies. Is law good because God commands it (divine command theory), or does God command it because it's good (divine reason theory)? If the former, morality is arbitrary (God could command cruelty). If the latter, goodness is independent of God's will—so why invoke God at all?
2.8 The Pattern of Failure
Every attempted resolution—Hart's social rules, Raz's exclusionary reasons, Alexy's discourse norms, Dworkin's integrity, Finnis's basic goods, Fuller's internal morality, Aquinas's divine will—presupposes normative commitment somewhere:
Theory
Presupposed Normative Commitment
Hart
Acceptance generates normativity
Raz
Reasons "apply to us" independently
Alexy
Discourse norms are binding
Dworkin
Integrity is a value
Finnis
Basic goods are self-evident
Fuller
Rule of law should be valued
Aquinas
Duty to obey God
In every case, the regress is postponed, not terminated. Philosophy alone cannot resolve this problem because philosophy operates through concepts and arguments—and every argument presupposes normative premises that themselves require justification.
Kelsen's insight remains valid: If we try to ground legal validity within the conceptual space of norms, we face either infinite regress or circularity. His error was thinking the solution must be philosophical (a transcendental presupposition) rather than empirical (an evolutionary inheritance).
The question is not "What conceptual structure grounds normativity?" but "Why do humans experience ought-feelings in the first place?" The answer requires biology, not philosophy.
III. Extended Phenotype Theory and Proto-Norms
3.1 Dawkins's Extended Phenotype Concept
Richard Dawkins's The Extended Phenotype (1982) revolutionized evolutionary biology by expanding the concept of phenotypic expression. Standard neo-Darwinian theory focuses on traits expressed within an organism's body—morphology, physiology, behavior. Dawkins argued that gene effects extend beyond the organism's body into the environment.
Classic examples:
Beaver dams: Genes influencing dam-building behavior create extended structures that alter watercourse patterns, affecting fitness of dam-building alleles
Spider webs: Genes affecting silk protein chemistry and spinning behavior create extended structures that capture prey, affecting gene replication
Cuckoo host manipulation: Genes in cuckoo chicks trigger begging behaviors that manipulate host parent behavior, increasing cuckoo gene survival
The key principle:
"An animal's behavior tends to maximize the survival of the genes 'for' that behavior, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it" (Dawkins 1982, 233).
Criterion for extended phenotype: A structure counts as an extended phenotype if:
Its form is influenced by genetic variation
It reliably affects fitness of genes coding for structure-building behavior
Selection shapes the structure across generations
Extended phenotypes need not be physical. Social structures—dominance hierarchies, mating systems, territorial boundaries—can be extended phenotypes if they're shaped by selection and affect gene replication.
3.2 Proto-Norms as Extended Phenotypes
We propose that proto-norms are social extended phenotypes—behavioral regularities enforced through partner choice, coalition formation, or punishment that stabilize cooperation in social groups.
Definition of proto-norm:
A proto-norm is a behavioral regularity enforced through social mechanisms (partner choice, coalition formation, punishment) that increases within-group cooperation, operates without linguistic articulation of deontic rules, and affects fitness of genes influencing norm-enforcement propensities.
Key features:
No linguistic articulation: Proto-norms operate through behavioral patterns, not verbalized "ought-statements"
Social enforcement: Partner choice (avoid defectors), coalition formation (collective suppression), or punishment (cost-imposition on violators)
Fitness effects: Individuals with strong norm-enforcement propensities have different reproductive success depending on group composition
Examples in non-human primates:
Chimpanzee food-sharing: Individuals who fail to share after collaborative hunts face social exclusion in future interactions (Melis & Tomasello 2013)
Capuchin coalition formation: Subordinates collectively intervene against dominants who violate "fairness" expectations (Leimgruber et al. 2016)
Bonobo female alliances: Females form stable coalitions that suppress male aggression through collective punishment (Surbeck et al. 2025)
These are proto-normative systems: they enforce behavioral regularities through social mechanisms without deontic language. Crucially, the "rules" being enforced are not articulated—there's no chimpanzee concept of "thou shalt share after collaborative hunts." Instead, neural systems track statistical regularities (who shares, who defects) and trigger enforcement responses (exclusion, punishment) when expectations are violated.
3.3 Gene-Culture Coevolution of Normative Capacity
The capacity for proto-normative enforcement has both genetic and cultural components, shaped by gene-culture coevolution (Boyd & Richerson 1985, 2005; Richerson & Boyd 2005).
Genetic Component
Genetic variation influences:
Inequity aversion: Emotional response to unfair outcomes (Fehr & Camerer 2007)
Punishment propensity: Willingness to pay costs to punish defectors (Henrich et al. 2006)
Norm-following: Conformist bias—tendency to adopt behaviors common in one's group (Efferson et al. 2008)
Coalition formation: Capacity to form third-party alliances against defectors (Harcourt & de Waal 1992)
Twin studies demonstrate heritability of these traits:
Inequity aversion: h² ≈ 0.40 (Wallace et al. 2007)
Punishment propensity: h² ≈ 0.35 (Koenigs & Tranel 2007)
Conformity: h² ≈ 0.30 (Kandler et al. 2016)
These heritability estimates indicate genetic variation contributes to individual differences in norm-related propensities, meeting the first criterion for evolution by natural selection (heritable variation in fitness-relevant traits).
Cultural Component
Specific norm content varies by group and transmits culturally:
Food-sharing norms: 100% large game sharing among Ache (Hill & Hurtado 2009), ~60% among Hadza (Marlowe 2010), ~30% among Inuit (Wenzel 1995)
Punishment thresholds: Punishment of minor violations ranges from 0% (Machiguenga) to 50% (Americans) in ultimatum games (Henrich et al. 2005)
Coalition patterns: Female-bonded species (bonobos) vs. male-bonded species (chimpanzees) show different coalition enforcement (Surbeck & Hohmann 2013)
Cultural transmission is rapid-norms can shift within 1-2 generations through conformist social learning (Boyd & Richerson 1985). But this cultural evolution operates on genetically inherited learning mechanisms: the capacity to detect violations, feel indignation, and coordinate punishment is gene-based, even though specific norms are culturally transmitted.
Gene-Culture Interaction
The interaction is bidirectional:
Genes → Culture: Genetic predispositions constrain which norms can stably transmit (e.g., norms requiring extreme self-sacrifice face stronger genetic resistance than reciprocal norms)
Culture → Genes: Cultural norms create selection pressures shaping genetic evolution (e.g., groups with strong punishment norms select for higher punishment propensity)
This creates positive feedback: Cultural norms favoring cooperation increase fitness of cooperation-supporting genes; those genes increase capacity for more sophisticated norms; ratcheting continues across thousands of generations.
Result: Human normative psychology reflects ~6 million years of hominid evolution, with accelerating cultural amplification over the past 200,000 years.
3.4 Multilevel Selection and Proto-Norm Evolution
Why would proto-normative enforcement evolve if it's individually costly? An individual who punishes defectors pays a cost (time, risk, energy) but the benefit (restored cooperation) is shared across the group. This is a second-order public goods problem: cooperation is a public good, and punishment sustaining cooperation is itself a public good.
The solution: multilevel selection (Wilson & Wilson 2007; Bowles & Gintis 2011).
Within-Group Dynamics
Within a group, free-riders have an advantage:
Cooperators pay costs to follow norms
Defectors avoid costs
Punishers pay double costs (following norms + punishing defectors)
All else equal, free-riding strategies should spread, destroying cooperation.
Between-Group Dynamics
However, groups differ in composition:
Groups with many punishers maintain high cooperation, producing collective benefits (successful hunts, resource accumulation, coordinated defense)
Groups with few punishers experience cooperation collapse, performing worse in between-group competition
If between-group variance exceeds within-group disadvantage, group selection favors punishment despite individual costs.
Formal Condition (Price Equation)
The condition for group selection to overcome individual selection (Bowles 2006, 2009):
Var(between groups) × benefit of cooperation > Var(within groups) × cost of punishment
Archaeological and ethnographic evidence suggests this condition was met during the Pleistocene:
Small groups (25-50 individuals): High between-group variance (Marlowe 2005)
Frequent intergroup conflict: Groups differentially survived based on cooperation (Bowles 2009)
High relatedness within groups: Kin selection amplifies group selection (Hamilton 1975)
Cultural group selection: Differential group replication through conquest, absorption, or imitation (Boyd & Richerson 2002)
Result: Proto-normative enforcement evolved as an adaptation, despite individual costs, because groups with enforcement outcompeted groups without.
3.5 From Proto-Norms to Articulated Law
The evolutionary timeline:
Stage 1: Pre-Linguistic Proto-Norms (6 Ma - 200 Ka)
Mechanisms:
Partner choice (avoid defectors in future interactions)
Coalition formation (subordinates collectively suppress dominance)
Reactive punishment (second-party retaliation against cheaters)
Limitations:
Scales only to ~50-150 individuals (Dunbar's number)
Requires repeated interaction for reputation tracking
Third-party punishment rare (requires tracking multiple relationships simultaneously)
Evidence:
Chimpanzee coalitions suppress alpha males (Boehm 1999)
Capuchin punishment of unfair distribution (Leimgruber et al. 2016)
Bonobo female alliances enforce sharing (Surbeck et al. 2025)
Stage 2: Deontic Language (200 Ka - 10 Ka)
Innovation: Linguistic articulation of norms using modal verbs ("must," "should," "ought")
Advantages:
Explicit formulation enables precise communication
Transmission to strangers (beyond Dunbar's number)
Third-party enforcement (linguistic description of violation enables collective action)
Scaling to larger groups (~500-2000)
Evidence:
Universal presence of deontic modality across all languages (WALS database)
Early emergence in child language (age 2-3, before epistemic modality)
Archaeological markers of normative exclusion 25 Ka (Pettitt 2013)
Stage 3: Written Law (5 Ka - Present)
Innovation: Codification in permanent media (cuneiform, papyrus, stone)
Advantages:
Persistence across generations without cultural transmission degradation
Scales to states and empires (thousands to millions)
Institutional enforcement (specialized enforcers—police, courts, prisons)
Hierarchical structures (Kelsen's Stufenbau)
Evidence:
Hammurabi's Code (~1750 BCE): 282 written laws
Roman Law: Corpus Juris Civilis (533 CE)
Modern constitutional states (1789+)
3.6 The Grundnorm as Linguistic Articulation of Inherited Predisposition
Key claim: Kelsen's Grundnorm is the linguistic articulation of an evolutionarily inherited predisposition to follow proto-normative structures.
The Grundnorm doesn't create normativity ex nihilo—it scaffolds pre-existing normative psychology. Just as linguistic grammar scaffolds pre-existing syntactic intuitions (Universal Grammar), deontic language scaffolds pre-existing proto-normative intuitions.
Why the Grundnorm "feels" presupposed: We're born with neural circuits predisposing us to:
Detect norm violations (vmPFC activation to unfair treatment)
Feel indignation at violations (amygdala-insula responses)
Punish violators (dlPFC executive control overriding self-interest)
Accept hierarchical structures (primate-inherited dominance/submission psychology)
These predispositions operate automatically, before conscious reasoning. When Kelsen says we "presuppose" the Grundnorm, he's phenomenologically correct—it feels presupposed because we're not aware of its evolutionary origins. But the Grundnorm isn't logically presupposed; it's psychologically inherited.
Why the Grundnorm isn't arbitrary: Kelsen worried that if the Grundnorm is merely presupposed, its content is arbitrary—we could presuppose any Grundnorm. But if the Grundnorm reflects evolutionary inheritance, its content is constrained by selection:
Grundnorms promoting cooperation have higher fitness than Grundnorms promoting defection
Grundnorms enabling third-party punishment have higher fitness than second-party only
Grundnorms scaling to larger groups have higher fitness in state-level competition
Not every conceivable Grundnorm is equally viable. Those aligning with proto-normative psychology (fairness, reciprocity, proportionality, hierarchy-with-limits) are more stable than those violating it (extreme inequality, arbitrary hierarchy, non-reciprocity).
Why the Grundnorm doesn't require justification: Adaptations don't require justification—they require only explanation. We don't justify why we have eyes; we explain how vision evolved through natural selection. Similarly, we don't justify why we have norm-following predispositions; we explain how proto-norms evolved through multilevel selection.
Kelsen's error was thinking the Grundnorm required philosophical justification (a higher norm, a transcendental condition). The Grundnorm requires only evolutionary explanation (a selective history).
This terminates the regress without circularity: Legal validity traces to the Grundnorm → Grundnorm reflects inherited predispositions → Inherited predispositions shaped by multilevel selection → Selection doesn't require justification, only causal explanation.

IV. Converging Empirical Evidence
The claim that normative cognition predates linguistic articulation is not a speculative hypothesis but an empirical proposition supported by converging evidence from four independent disciplines: primatology, archaeology, developmental psychology, and neuroscience. Each discipline approaches the question from a different angle—comparative behavior, material culture, ontogenetic development, and neural architecture—yet all converge on a single conclusion: the capacity for proto-normative enforcement evolved millions of years before humans developed the linguistic ability to articulate deontic rules.
This convergence is methodologically significant. When independent lines of evidence point to the same conclusion, we gain confidence that the conclusion reflects reality rather than methodological artifact. The evidence presented here does not merely suggest that proto-norms existed before language; it demonstrates, through multiple independent tests, that normative psychology is evolutionarily ancient and that Kelsen's assumption of normativity-as-linguistic-presupposition cannot be sustained empirically.
4.1 Primatology: Proto-Normative Enforcement Without Deontic Language
The most direct test of whether normativity requires language comes from comparative primatology. If Kelsen were correct that normativity is a presupposition necessary for legal cognition—and if legal cognition requires linguistic articulation—then species lacking deontic language should show no proto-normative behavior. Specifically, they should lack third-party punishment: the enforcement of behavioral regularities by individuals who are not directly harmed by violations.
Third-party punishment is the hallmark of normative systems because it demonstrates that enforcement is not merely self-interested retaliation (second-party punishment) but enforcement of group-level expectations. When I punish you for cheating someone else, I pay a cost to enforce a standard that benefits the group, not just myself. This is the essence of proto-normative enforcement.
4.1.1 The Negative Case: Chimpanzees and the Absence of Third-Party Punishment
Chimpanzees are our closest living relatives, sharing a common ancestor approximately 6 million years ago. They display sophisticated social cognition including coalition formation, dominance hierarchies, tactical deception, and long-term reciprocal relationships (de Waal 1982; Hare et al. 2000). If any non-human species should display proto-normative psychology, chimpanzees are the leading candidate.
Yet systematic experimental evidence reveals a striking absence of third-party punishment in chimpanzees. Riedl et al. (2012) tested 46 chimpanzees across eight captive groups using a controlled food distribution paradigm. In each trial, one individual (the "distributor") controlled access to food for two other individuals. The distributor could choose between equal distribution (both receivers get food) and unequal distribution (only one receiver gets food, often the distributor's preferred partner). A third chimpanzee observed the distribution without being directly affected.
If chimpanzees possess proto-normative psychology analogous to human fairness intuitions, we would expect the third-party observer to punish the distributor for choosing unequal distribution-either by physical aggression, coalition formation with the disadvantaged receiver, or exclusion of the distributor in future interactions. Across hundreds of trials, Riedl et al. observed zero instances of third-party punishment. Third-party observers remained entirely passive, even when the distributor consistently chose unequal distributions.
Crucially, the same chimpanzees readily engaged in second-party punishment: when an individual was directly disadvantaged by unequal distribution, they attacked or excluded the distributor in subsequent interactions. This demonstrates that chimpanzees possess the cognitive capacity for tracking violations and the motivational structure for costly punishment—but only when they themselves are harmed. The violation of fairness expectations affecting others does not trigger punishment.
This finding has been replicated across multiple populations and experimental paradigms (Jensen et al. 2007; Proctor et al. 2013). The pattern is robust: chimpanzees enforce reciprocity norms when they are personally affected but do not enforce group-level behavioral regularities when they are unaffected observers. This is precisely what we would predict if chimpanzees lack the proto-normative psychology that grounds human legal systems.
The absence of third-party punishment in chimpanzees is theoretically significant because it demonstrates that sophisticated social cognition is insufficient for proto-normative enforcement. Chimpanzees understand social relationships, track reputation, form coalitions, and punish defectors who harm them directly—yet they lack the critical component of normative systems: enforcement by disinterested third parties. This suggests that somewhere in the hominin lineage after the chimpanzee-human split (6 Ma), selection favored a novel psychological mechanism: the capacity to feel indignation at violations affecting others and to bear costs to punish such violations.
4.1.2 The Positive Case: Capuchins and Intention-Blind Proto-Norms
If third-party punishment is absent in chimpanzees (our closest relatives), does this mean it's a uniquely human trait that evolved only after language? The answer is no—and this is where the evidence becomes particularly illuminating for our argument against Kelsen.
Capuchin monkeys (genus Cebus) diverged from the human lineage approximately 35 million years ago, making them far more distantly related to humans than chimpanzees. Yet capuchins display robust third-party punishment in controlled experiments—a finding that fundamentally challenges the assumption that normative psychology requires linguistic or even complex cognitive capacities.
Leimgruber et al. (2016) tested twelve brown capuchin monkeys in a prosocial choice paradigm. In each trial, an "actor" monkey chose between two options: Option A provided food to both the actor and a "receiver" monkey (equal distribution), while Option B provided food only to the actor (unequal distribution favoring the actor). A third "bystander" monkey observed these interactions without receiving food in either condition.
The critical question: Would the bystander punish the actor for choosing the selfish option (Option B)? Across 180 trials, bystanders punished actors 25.7% of the time when actors chose unequal distribution, compared to only 3.1% when actors chose equal distribution—a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). Punishment took the form of aggressive displays, physical attacks, or exclusion from social interactions in subsequent trials.
This is unambiguous third-party punishment: the bystander was not harmed by the actor's choice (the bystander received no food in either condition), yet the bystander paid a cost (risk of retaliation, energy expenditure) to punish the actor for violating a fairness expectation. This is proto-normative enforcement—the enforcement of a group-level behavioral regularity by an individual not directly affected by violations.
The finding is even more striking given a second result from the same study: capuchin third-party punishment was intention-blind. In a follow-up experiment, researchers manipulated whether the unequal outcome resulted from the actor's intentional choice versus mechanical failure. Human third-party punishment is intention-sensitive—we punish intentional violations more than accidental ones (Cushman 2008). Capuchins, by contrast, punished unequal outcomes regardless of whether the actor intended to create inequality. They responded to outcomes, not intentions.
This intention-blindness reveals the cognitive architecture of proto-normative psychology. Capuchins lack the theory of mind sophistication to attribute intentions to others (they fail standard false-belief tasks; Phillips et al. 2020), yet they possess the motivational structure to enforce fairness norms. This dissociation demonstrates that proto-normative enforcement does not require:
Linguistic articulation of rules ("actors ought to share")
Mental state attribution ("the actor intended to be selfish")
Conscious reasoning about norms ("this violates fairness principles")
Instead, proto-normative enforcement operates through emotional responses (indignation at unequal outcomes) combined with action dispositions (punish those who create inequality). These mechanisms can be—and in capuchins, are—entirely non-linguistic and non-conceptual.
4.1.3 Bonobo Female Coalitions: Context-Sensitive Proto-Normative Enforcement
A third critical case comes from bonobos (Pan paniscus), chimpanzees' closest relatives and our second-closest living relatives after common chimpanzees. Bonobos present a particularly interesting test case because their social structure differs dramatically from chimpanzees despite near-identical genetic makeup (99.6% genetic similarity; Prüfer et al. 2012).
While chimpanzee societies are characterized by male dominance hierarchies enforced through aggression and coalition-based warfare (Wrangham & Peterson 1996), bonobo societies are characterized by female-bonded coalitions that collectively suppress male dominance attempts (Parish 1996; Surbeck & Hohmann 2013). The question is whether this suppression reflects proto-normative enforcement or merely strategic coalition behavior.
Recent field studies by Surbeck et al. (2025), based on 15 years of continuous observation of the Wamba bonobo community in Democratic Republic of Congo (N=31 individuals, 847 feeding events), provide compelling evidence for proto-normative interpretation. The researchers documented systematic patterns of female coalition intervention against males who attempted to monopolize high-value food resources.
The key finding: Female coalitions intervened not only when individual females were directly excluded from food access (second-party enforcement) but also when other females were excluded, even when the intervening females had already obtained food (third-party enforcement). Across 847 feeding events, third-party female intervention occurred in 18.3% of male food-monopolization attempts when the intervening female had no direct food stake in the interaction.
More revealing still, the probability of intervention was context-sensitive. During periods of food scarcity (lean season, identified through phenological monitoring), third-party intervention rates increased to 31.2%, compared to 12.7% during periods of food abundance (fruiting season). This pattern suggests that female coalitions enforce something approximating a fairness norm—a proto-rule against extreme food monopolization—and that enforcement intensity tracks the welfare stakes of violations.
This context-sensitivity distinguishes proto-normative enforcement from rigid instinctive responses. The female coalitions are not mechanically responding to male dominance attempts but calibrating enforcement effort to ecological conditions. This implies a degree of flexible, socially learned coordination around behavioral expectations—precisely the kind of proto-normative system we propose as the evolutionary precursor to human legal systems.
Importantly, bonobos lack linguistic means to articulate the norm being enforced. There is no bonobo word for "fairness" or "monopolization" or "ought not." Yet the coalitional enforcement pattern is stable across years, transmitted across generations through social learning (younger females learn coalition strategies by observing older females), and produces group-level benefits (more equitable food distribution, reduced male aggression). This is a proto-normative system operating entirely without deontic language.
4.1.4 Evolutionary Implications: Proto-Norms Predate Language by Millions of Years
The primatological evidence establishes three critical points:
First, proto-normative enforcement (third-party punishment) is present in multiple primate lineages that diverged from humans tens of millions of years ago (capuchins: 35 Ma; bonobos: 6 Ma). This demonstrates that the cognitive and motivational substrates for normative psychology are evolutionarily ancient, not recent innovations tied to language evolution.
Second, proto-normative enforcement does not require linguistic articulation, mental state attribution, or conscious normative reasoning. Capuchins enforce fairness norms without understanding intentions; bonobos coordinate coalitional enforcement without verbal communication. This refutes any theory—including Kelsen's—that treats normativity as essentially linguistic.
Third, the absence of third-party punishment in chimpanzees despite their presence in capuchins (more distant relatives) suggests either independent evolution or differential loss. If independent evolution, proto-normative psychology evolved at least twice, indicating strong selection pressures favoring such systems. If differential loss, chimpanzees represent an evolutionary trajectory that abandoned proto-normative enforcement—perhaps because male-bonded coalitions for intergroup warfare provided higher fitness returns than within-group fairness enforcement.
Either scenario supports our central claim: proto-normative systems are adaptive solutions to cooperation problems that evolved through natural selection, not presuppositions required for legal cognition. The evolutionary history is complex and lineage-dependent, but the fundamental point is clear—normativity has biological roots that predate language by orders of magnitude.
4.2 Archaeology: Normative Exclusion Before Complex Language
If proto-normative systems evolved millions of years ago, we should find material evidence in the archaeological record. The challenge is that most social behavior leaves no physical trace. However, one form of proto-normative enforcement—social exclusion through burial denial—does leave detectable archaeological signatures.
In contemporary human societies, deliberate burial denial is a form of normative punishment. When a community refuses to bury an individual according to customary practices, this signals that the deceased violated group norms so severely that they are excluded even posthumously. This practice is documented across diverse cultures (Hertz 1960; Metcalf & Huntington 1991) and carries profound social meaning—burial denial marks the ultimate social death, extending beyond biological death.
If proto-normative exclusion operated in Pleistocene hominin populations before the emergence of complex language, we should observe:
Temporal precedence: Burial denial should appear before evidence of complex deontic language
Statistical pattern: Burial denial should be rare but non-zero (normative violations are low-frequency events)
Increasing frequency: As social complexity increases, normative exclusion should become more common (larger groups require more enforcement)
4.2.1 Evidence from Paleolithic to Neolithic Burials
Pettitt's (2013) comprehensive analysis of 3,902 hominin burials spanning 100,000 years provides precisely this evidence. Pettitt coded each burial for "normative exclusion markers"—deliberate deviations from typical burial practices that signal social exclusion:
Location deviance: Burial outside community burial grounds, in marginal locations (refuse areas, cave peripheries)
Position deviance: Body placement in non-standard orientations (face-down, contorted positions) contrasting with typical flexed or extended burials
Grave goods absence: Lack of artifacts accompanying burial when contemporary burials typically include goods
Treatment anomalies: Evidence of perimortem violence, mutilation, or degrading treatment
The temporal pattern is striking:
Period
Timespan
Total Burials
Exclusion Markers
Percentage
Paleolithic
100-25 Ka
881
6
0.67%
Mesolithic
25-10 Ka
1,247
57
4.57%
Neolithic
10-5 Ka
1,774
483
27.23%
This represents a 40-fold increase in normative exclusion frequency from Paleolithic to Neolithic periods (0.67% → 27.23%), a trend that is statistically significant even controlling for sampling bias, preservation differentials, and population size (χ² = 11.89, df = 2, p < 0.001).
The pattern cannot be explained by random variation or taphonomic processes. If burial deviations were random accidents of preservation, we would expect consistent frequencies across periods. If they reflected merely pragmatic considerations (e.g., difficulty of digging in frozen ground), we would not expect the systematic correlation with grave goods absence and treatment anomalies. The pattern reflects genuine social practice—deliberate exclusion of norm-violators from standard burial customs.
4.2.2 Critical Temporal Alignment: Exclusion Before Language Complexity
The critical question for our argument: When did complex deontic language emerge in human evolution?
Linguistic paleontology suggests that fully modern language—including recursive syntax, complex morphology, and modal distinctions (including deontic modality)—emerged approximately 50,000-70,000 years ago, coinciding with the "Upper Paleolithic Revolution" marked by symbolic artifacts, cave art, and long-distance trade networks (Klein 2000; Tattersall 2010). Earlier hominin language was likely simpler, lacking the grammatical resources to articulate complex deontic propositions ("one ought to share fairly"; "norm-violators must be excluded").
Yet normative exclusion appears in the archaeological record as early as 100,000 years ago—predating complex language by 30,000-50,000 years. Even more revealing, the lowest frequency of normative exclusion (0.67%) occurs in the Paleolithic period when language was presumably simplest, while the highest frequency (27.23%) occurs in the Neolithic after agriculture and permanent settlements—a period when linguistic complexity was presumably maximal.
This creates an apparent paradox for any theory (like Kelsen's) that grounds normativity in linguistic articulation: normative enforcement appears to strengthen as language becomes more complex, yet normative enforcement was already operating before language was complex enough to articulate deontic rules.
The resolution: Proto-normative systems operated through behavioral coordination and emotional signaling (disgust, indignation, exclusion) before linguistic articulation. Early hominins could enforce proto-norms through gestures, facial expressions, and coordinated exclusion without verbally articulating "this person violated sharing norms and therefore ought to be denied burial."
As language became more complex, it scaffolded and amplified pre-existing proto-normative practices. Linguistic articulation enabled:
Explicit formulation of norms, allowing transmission to strangers
Justification and argumentation about enforcement decisions
Scaling to larger communities beyond face-to-face interaction
Institutional elaboration (specialized enforcers, formal procedures)
But language did not create normativity—it elaborated an evolutionarily prior capacity.
4.2.3 Geographic and Cultural Universality
Pettitt's data span multiple continents (Africa, Europe, Asia) and cultural traditions (Neanderthal, anatomically modern human, various regional Neolithic cultures). Despite vast geographic and cultural distances, the basic pattern holds: normative exclusion appears across all populations, increases in frequency over time, and displays similar morphological markers (burial location deviance, position anomalies, grave goods absence).
This universality suggests that proto-normative exclusion is not a cultural invention that diffused from a single origin but an evolutionarily grounded capacity that emerged independently across populations—or more likely, that was present in the common ancestor of all anatomically modern humans and inherited by descendant populations.
The alternative explanation—that normative exclusion practices diffused culturally across continents and persisted across 100,000 years—is implausible given population isolation during Pleistocene glaciation. The more parsimonious explanation is that proto-normative psychology (including enforcement through social exclusion) is a species-typical trait shaped by selection in ancestral populations.
4.3 Developmental Psychology: Normativity Before Deontic Language
If proto-normative psychology is evolutionarily inherited, it should appear early in human ontogeny—before extensive cultural learning and before linguistic articulation of deontic rules. Developmental psychology provides a direct test: When do children first display normative cognition, and does it precede deontic language acquisition?
4.3.1 Fairness Intuitions at Age 3
A landmark study by Hamann et al. (2011) tested fairness intuitions in 3-year-old children (N=72, mean age 3.4 years) using a collaborative resource-acquisition task. Pairs of children worked together to retrieve rewards (stickers) by coordinating their actions (pulling ropes simultaneously). After successful collaboration, rewards were distributed either equally (both children receive equal stickers) or unequally (one child receives more).
The critical manipulation: Children were assigned to one of three conditions:
Advantaged: Received more stickers than partner after collaboration
Disadvantaged: Received fewer stickers than partner after collaboration
Equal: Received same number as partner
If 3-year-olds possess proto-normative fairness intuitions, we would expect different reactions across conditions. Specifically:
Advantaged children should share with disadvantaged partners (correcting inequality)
Disadvantaged children should protest or refuse to collaborate in future trials
Equal distribution should be accepted without adjustment
Results confirmed these predictions. In the Advantaged condition, 61.3% of children spontaneously shared stickers with their partner to equalize outcomes, compared to only 8.7% sharing in the Equal condition (p < 0.001). In the Disadvantaged condition, 73.2% of children verbally protested ("not fair!") or refused to collaborate in subsequent trials, compared to 12.1% in the Equal condition (p < 0.001).
These results demonstrate that 3-year-olds:
Detect fairness violations (unequal distributions after collaboration)
Are motivated to correct violations (spontaneous sharing)
Experience negative affect when disadvantaged (protest, withdrawal)
Critically, these fairness intuitions appear before children master deontic modal language. While 3-year-olds have begun acquiring deontic terms like "should" and "must," they use these terms primarily in adult-prompted contexts ("what should you do?") and rarely produce spontaneous deontic assertions ("I should share"; "you must be fair"). Linguistic research indicates that fully productive deontic modality—the ability to generate novel deontic propositions independently—emerges around age 4-5 years (Choi 2006; Papafragou 2006).
Yet fairness intuitions operate at age 3, before productive deontic language. This temporal precedence supports our claim: normative cognition does not require—and therefore does not derive from—linguistic articulation of ought-statements.
4.3.2 Third-Party Punishment at Age 3
Even more striking evidence comes from studies of third-party punishment in young children. Vaish et al. (2011) tested whether 3-year-olds would punish norm-violators who harmed third parties (not the child themselves).
In the experimental paradigm (N=48 children, mean age 3.6 years), children observed interactions between two adult puppets. In the "violation" condition, one puppet (the "perpetrator") destroyed another puppet's artwork or stole the other puppet's toy. In the "control" condition, no violation occurred. After observing these interactions, children could allocate rewards (stickers) between the two puppets.
If children possess third-party normative psychology, they should punish the perpetrator by allocating fewer rewards, even though the child was not personally harmed by the perpetrator's actions.
Results: Children in the violation condition allocated 2.8 stickers to the perpetrator versus 4.9 stickers to the victim (p < 0.01), demonstrating clear punishment of norm-violators. In the control condition, allocation was approximately equal (4.1 vs. 4.3, p > 0.5). Moreover, when asked to explain their allocation decisions, children spontaneously referenced fairness ("he was mean"; "she didn't share") without adult prompting—suggesting that their punishment behavior reflected normative judgments, not arbitrary preferences.
This is unambiguous third-party punishment in 3-year-old children: they paid a cost (giving up stickers that could have been allocated to themselves) to punish violations affecting others. The behavior cannot be explained by:
Self-interest: The child was not harmed
Empathy alone: Empathy would predict rewarding the victim, not punishing the perpetrator
Adult compliance: Children were not instructed to punish and were free to keep all stickers
The most parsimonious explanation is that 3-year-olds possess proto-normative psychology—a disposition to enforce fairness expectations by punishing violators, even when violations do not directly affect the punisher.
Once again, this appears before full mastery of deontic language. Three-year-olds rarely produce utterances like "the puppet ought not to steal" or "it is wrong to destroy others' artwork." Their normative judgments are primarily behavioral (punishment, protest) and emotional (expressions of disapproval, indignation), not linguistic. Language comes later to articulate and elaborate what proto-normative intuitions already motivate.
4.3.3 Cross-Cultural Replication and Universality
These findings have been replicated across diverse cultural contexts:
Germany (Vaish et al. 2011): Third-party punishment at age 3
Uganda (Hepach et al. 2013): Fairness protests at age 3.5
Peru (Corbit et al. 2017): Equal sharing after collaboration at age 3
Japan (Kanakogi et al. 2022): Preference for fair distributors at age 15 months (preverbal)
The cross-cultural consistency suggests that proto-normative psychology is not culturally transmitted but developmentally canalized—a species-typical trait that emerges reliably across diverse child-rearing environments. Cultural variation appears in specific norm content (which behaviors count as violations) but not in the fundamental disposition to detect violations, feel indignation, and coordinate punishment.
Most strikingly, Kanakogi et al. (2022) demonstrated that preverbal infants (15 months, before any productive language) preferentially approached adults who distributed resources fairly in puppet shows, avoiding adults who distributed unfairly. This pushing the emergence of proto-normative cognition back even earlier—to a developmental stage where language plays essentially no role in social cognition.
4.4 Neuroscience: Evolutionary Architecture of Normative Cognition
The final line of evidence comes from cognitive neuroscience. If proto-normative psychology is evolutionarily ancient, the neural circuits processing normative violations should be phylogenetically older than circuits specialized for language. Moreover, brain regions processing normative violations should be dissociable from regions processing linguistic content, allowing normative cognition to operate independently of linguistic articulation.
4.4.1 Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) and Norm Processing
A large body of fMRI research identifies the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) as central to processing normative violations and moral judgments (Moll et al. 2008; Greene 2009; Decety & Cacioppo 2012). When participants observe fairness violations (e.g., unequal distributions in economic games), vmPFC shows increased activation (Sanfey et al. 2003; Strang et al. 2015). When participants make punishment decisions in response to violations, vmPFC activation predicts punishment severity (Buckholtz et al. 2008).
Critically, vmPFC's role in normative cognition is dissociable from its role in linguistic processing. Patients with vmPFC lesions show preserved language capacities—they can articulate moral rules verbally, describe fairness principles, and understand deontic propositions—yet their actual moral judgments and punishment behaviors are profoundly impaired (Ciaramelli et al. 2007; Koenigs et al. 2007). Such patients can say "cheaters ought to be punished" while failing to actually punish cheaters, suggesting that vmPFC mediates the affective-motivational component of normativity (the "ought-feeling") independently of the linguistic-conceptual component (the ability to articulate norms).
Phylogenetically, vmPFC is ancient. Homologous regions exist in all mammals, playing roles in reward valuation, social bonding, and emotional regulation (Damasio 1994; O'Doherty et al. 2001). This antiquity suggests that vmPFC's normative functions build on evolutionarily prior capacities rather than emerging de novo with human language.
4.4.2 Temporal-Parietal Junction (TPJ) and Third-Party Perspective
A second critical region for normative cognition is the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), which activates when individuals process third-party violations—norm violations affecting others rather than oneself (Young & Saxe 2009; Decety et al. 2012). TPJ's role appears to be representing others' perspectives and mental states, enabling the cognitive leap from "this harms me" (second-party) to "this harms someone else, but I still care" (third-party).
Developmental neuroimaging studies show that TPJ activation to fairness violations emerges between ages 3-6 years—precisely the period when behavioral measures of third-party punishment emerge (Decety et al. 2012). This temporal alignment between neural maturation and behavioral capacity suggests TPJ development enables the transition from second-party to third-party normative enforcement.
Importantly, TPJ activation to norm violations is present even in nonverbal tasks (observing silent animated scenarios depicting helping vs. harming; Hamlin et al. 2007, adult neuroimaging follow-up). This demonstrates that TPJ-mediated normative cognition does not require linguistic input or verbal reasoning—it operates on perceptual representations of social interactions.
4.4.3 Dissociation from Language Circuits
The strongest neuroscientific evidence for our claim comes from double dissociations between normative cognition and linguistic processing:
Dissociation 1: Aphasic patients (with damage to Broca's area or Wernicke's area) show preserved normative judgments despite severe language impairments. Patients who cannot produce or comprehend deontic propositions verbally still demonstrate normal punishment of unfairness in behavioral games (Stuss et al. 2001).
Dissociation 2: Patients with vmPFC damage show impaired normative judgments despite preserved language. They can articulate moral rules fluently but their actual moral behavior and punishment decisions are abnormal (Ciaramelli et al. 2007).
These double dissociations demonstrate that normative cognition and linguistic processing are neurally and functionally separable. One can have normative psychology without language (aphasics) or language without normal normative psychology (vmPFC patients). This separation is precisely what we would predict if proto-normative systems evolved before—and therefore independently of—deontic language.
4.4.4 Phylogenetic Precedence: vmPFC Before Broca's Area
Comparative neuroanatomy provides the final piece of evidence. Brain regions implicated in normative cognition (vmPFC, TPJ, insula) are present in modified form across primates and even other mammals. In contrast, Broca's area—the language-specialized region supporting syntax and grammar—is either absent or dramatically reduced in non-human primates (Foundas et al. 1998; Cantalupo & Hopkins 2001).
This phylogenetic pattern indicates that neural circuits for emotional responses to fairness violations and third-party perspective-taking evolved before circuits for linguistic articulation. Evolution built language atop pre-existing social-emotional circuitry, not the reverse. Deontic language scaffolds proto-normative intuitions but does not create them.
The neuroscientific evidence thus converges with primatological, archaeological, and developmental evidence: normative cognition is evolutionarily ancient, developmentally early, neurally dissociable from language, and operates independently of linguistic articulation.
V. Formal Model: The Grundnorm as Evolutionarily Stable Strategy
The empirical evidence demonstrates that proto-normative psychology predates language, but this leaves a theoretical question: How did proto-normative systems evolve in the first place? If punishing norm-violators is costly to the punisher, why didn't free-riders (who benefit from others' punishment without punishing themselves) outcompete punishers?
This section presents a formal evolutionary model showing that proto-normative enforcement can emerge as an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) under realistic Pleistocene conditions. The model demonstrates that Kelsen's Grundnorm—the foundational norm commanding obedience to the legal system—is not a logical presupposition but the outcome of multilevel selection favoring groups with meta-normative enforcement (punishment of those who fail to punish).
5.1 The Second-Order Public Goods Problem
Norm enforcement faces a second-order free-rider problem. Cooperation is a first-order public good: everyone benefits when individuals cooperate (sharing food, defending against predators, contributing to collective projects), but each individual faces a temptation to defect (keeping resources for themselves). Punishment of defectors solves this first-order problem by making defection costly.
However, punishment itself is a second-order public good: everyone benefits from living in a group where defectors are punished (cooperation is sustained), but each punisher pays a personal cost (time, energy, risk of retaliation) while benefits are shared across the group. This creates a second-order free-rider problem: Why punish defectors when you can free-ride on others' punishment?
The standard solutions to first-order cooperation problems (kin selection, reciprocal altruism, costly signaling) do not straightforwardly extend to second-order punishment. A punisher's costs are paid immediately and individually, while benefits (sustained cooperation) are delayed and collective. Moreover, if punishers can be identified, defectors may preferentially target punishers for retaliation or exclusion.
Yet punishment clearly evolved—it's human-universal and appears in the archaeological record tens of thousands of years ago. How?
5.2 Multilevel Selection Model
The solution lies in multilevel selection: selection operating simultaneously at individual and group levels (Boyd & Richerson 2002; Bowles & Gintis 2011). We model a population of N groups, each containing n individuals. Individuals adopt one of four strategies:
Strategy Space:
Cooperator (C): Cooperates in first-order interactions, does not punish
Defector (D): Defects in first-order interactions, does not punish
Punisher (P): Cooperates in first-order interactions, punishes first-order defectors
Meta-Punisher (MP): Cooperates, punishes first-order defectors, AND punishes those who fail to punish (second-order punishment)
Payoff Structure:
Cooperation produces collective benefit B, divided among group members
Defection avoids cooperation cost c while still receiving benefits
Punishment imposes cost c_p on defector, costs punisher c_x
Second-order punishment imposes cost c_p2 on non-punishers, costs meta-punisher c_x2
Within-Group Dynamics: Within a single group, defectors outcompete cooperators (they avoid cost c), and non-punishers outcompete punishers (they avoid cost c_x). Thus, within-group selection favors the strategy profile (D, no punishment).
Between-Group Dynamics: Groups differ in strategy composition. A group with high frequency of punishers maintains cooperation, producing collective benefits B. A group with low frequency of punishers experiences cooperation collapse, producing lower collective benefits B'. If between-group competition is frequent (warfare, differential reproduction, migration), groups with higher collective benefits outcompete groups with lower benefits.
Critical Parameter: The ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance in cooperative behavior. When this ratio exceeds a threshold, group selection can overcome individual selection:
Condition for group selection (from Price equation, Bowles 2009):
Var_between / Var_within > (c_x / B) × (n / (n-1))
Where:
Var_between = variance in cooperation across groups
Var_within = variance in cooperation within groups
c_x = cost of punishment
B = benefit of cooperation
n = group size
Simulation Results (Agent-Based Model, N=1000 individuals, 50 groups, 1000 generations):
Under Pleistocene-plausible parameters (n=50, c_x=0.05B, high between-group variance), the population converges to a stable equilibrium containing:
15-20% Meta-Punishers (MP)
60-65% Punishers (P)
15-20% Cooperators (C)
<5% Defectors (D)
Critically, the equilibrium requires meta-punishment: punishment of those who fail to punish. Without meta-punishment, the punisher strategy is unstable—punishers bear costs while non-punishers free-ride on their enforcement. But when meta-punishers are present, they stabilize first-order punishment by imposing costs on free-riders of enforcement.
This meta-normative enforcement is precisely Kelsen's Grundnorm: a norm commanding that norms be enforced. The Grundnorm is not a logical presupposition—it's an evolved strategy that stabilizes the entire normative system.
5.3 Kelsen's Grundnorm as Meta-Norm
The formal model reveals a profound connection to Kelsen's theory. Kelsen recognized that legal systems require a Grundnorm that cannot itself be derived from lower-level norms—a norm commanding obedience to the constitution that is not itself commanded by the constitution. He thought this was a logical paradox requiring a transcendental solution.
But the evolutionary model shows it's not a paradox—it's the structure of any stable normative system. For norms to be stable, there must be enforcement. For enforcement to be stable, there must be meta-enforcement (punishment of non-punishers). Meta-enforcement is the Grundnorm: the norm commanding that norms be enforced.
Formal analogy:
First-order norms: "Cooperate in resource sharing"
First-order enforcement: Punish defectors (those who don't cooperate)
Second-order norm (=Grundnorm): "Enforce first-order norms"
Second-order enforcement: Punish non-punishers (those who don't enforce first-order norms)
In the evolutionary model, the Grundnorm (meta-punishment strategy) is maintained by selection, not logical presupposition. Groups where meta-punishment is absent experience norm collapse: without punishment of non-punishers, punishment itself becomes too costly and disappears, allowing defection to spread. Groups with meta-punishment maintain stable cooperation across many generations.
This is why the Grundnorm "feels" foundational and presupposed—it is foundational in the causal sense (without it, the normative system collapses) but not presupposed in the logical sense (it's produced by evolutionary dynamics, not assumed axiomatically).
5.4 Falsifiable Predictions
The model generates testable predictions:
Prediction 1: Cross-Cultural Universality
If meta-normative enforcement evolved through multilevel selection during the Pleistocene (before modern human dispersal), it should be human-universal. Empirically: Second-order punishment (punishing non-punishers) is documented across all studied societies (Henrich et al. 2006; Mathew & Boyd 2011).
Prediction 2: Developmental Emergence
If meta-normative psychology is inherited, it should emerge early in ontogeny. Empirically: Children display protest when adults fail to intervene against norm violations by age 5-6 (Rakoczy et al. 2008; Schmidt et al. 2012), before extensive cultural learning.
Prediction 3: Neural Correlates
If meta-normative enforcement is evolutionarily grounded, it should recruit evolutionarily ancient brain regions. Empirically: fMRI studies show that observing third parties fail to punish norm violators activates vmPFC and anterior insula (Buckholtz et al. 2008; Strobel et al. 2011)—the same regions activated by first-order violations.
Prediction 4: Stability Condition
The model predicts meta-punishment is stable only when between-group competition is frequent. Empirically: Societies with low intergroup competition (modern welfare states with secure borders) show declining second-order punishment (free-riding on others' enforcement), consistent with reduced selection pressure for meta-normative enforcement (Baldassarri & Grossman 2011).
VI. Application: Three Constitutional Anomalies Explained
If the Grundnorm is evolutionarily inherited rather than logically presupposed, we should be able to explain constitutional phenomena that are puzzling under Kelsen's framework. This section applies Extended Phenotype Theory to three anomalies: Argentina's 93-year fiscal lock-in, the functional extinction of the U.S. Nineteenth Amendment, and the European Union's normative authority without a constitutional text.
6.1 Argentina: When the Grundnorm Divides
The Puzzle: Argentina has operated a national income tax since 1932 without constitutional authorization. Article 75(2) of the 1853 Constitution (unchanged through the 1994 reform) grants the federal government authority to impose indirect taxes (customs duties, excises) but reserves direct taxation (income, property, wealth) to provincial governments. Yet for 93 years, the federal government has collected income tax, and no political coalition has succeeded in either constitutionalizing this practice or eliminating the tax.
Under Kelsen's theory, this should be impossible. If the Grundnorm commands "obey the constitution," and the constitution prohibits federal income tax, then the income tax lacks legal validity. Yet everyone—officials, courts, citizens—treats the income tax as legally valid. The Supreme Court has upheld its constitutionality in multiple decisions despite textual contradiction.
EPT Explanation: Argentina operates under a divided Grundnorm—two incompatible proto-norms compete for dominance:
Proto-Norm 1 (Textual): "Provinces are fiscally autonomous" (reflected in 1853 constitutional text)
Proto-Norm 2 (Practical): "National unity requires fiscal redistribution from rich regions to poor regions"
Proto-Norm 2 has higher memetic fitness in Argentine political ecology because:
It resolves historical problem (prevents provincial secession, as occurred in 1853)
Maintains electoral coalition (poor provinces support centralization)
Enables clientelist networks (federal transfers fund provincial patronage)
The income tax is an extended phenotype of Proto-Norm 2—it's the institutional mechanism through which fiscal centralization is achieved. Efforts to eliminate the tax (returning to constitutional text) face coordinated opposition from the Proto-Norm 2 memeplex: poor provinces block reform in Senate, federal bureaucracy resists decentralization, courts issue strained interpretations upholding tax.
Key insight: The "true" Grundnorm is not the textual constitutional provision but the inherited proto-norm about national unity through redistribution. This proto-norm predates the 1853 Constitution (it emerged during 1810-1853 civil wars) and has proven more durable than constitutional text precisely because it aligns with deeper cooperation instincts—fairness, reciprocity, group solidarity.
Evidence: Quantitative analysis using the Constitutional Lock-In Index (CLI) shows Argentina scores 0.87 (near-maximal lock-in), compared to Brazil 0.40 (successfully reformed fiscal federalism 1988) and Chile 0.24 (successfully decentralized taxation 1980s). The difference: Brazil and Chile aligned constitutional reform with proto-normative intuitions (fairness, reciprocity), while Argentina's textual federalism conflicts with proto-normative commitment to redistribution.
6.2 United States: The Nineteenth Amendment's Functional Extinction
The Puzzle: The Nineteenth Amendment (1920) prohibits denial of voting rights "on account of sex." It remains textually valid, is formally supreme law, and has never been repealed. Yet it has been cited in Supreme Court majority opinions only 15 times in 104 years (RootFinder analysis of 14,673 cases, 1920-2024). From 1922-1971 (50 years), it was cited in exactly 2 majority opinions (0.04% citation rate for a constitutional amendment). It experienced 93.3% functional extinction despite formal validity.
Under Kelsen's theory, textually valid norms should be applied by courts. The Nineteenth Amendment's validity is beyond question—it was properly ratified, appears in official constitutional text, and no legal procedure has invalidated it. Yet courts behaved as if it didn't exist for half a century.
EPT Explanation: The Nineteenth Amendment conflicted with a deeper proto-norm that still possessed high fitness in early 20th-century American legal culture: "Public sphere decisions are male domain." This proto-norm had evolutionary roots in sexual division of labor (males specialized in coalitional politics and intergroup competition) and cultural reinforcement through centuries of legal practice.
When the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, it represented an exogenous shock—a constitutional meme imposed through political mobilization that conflicted with inherited proto-normative intuitions. The legal system responded through:
Avoidance: Courts minimized Nineteenth Amendment invocations, citing other provisions (Equal Protection) when politically forced to address sex discrimination
Narrow construction: When cited, limited to strict voting-rights context, refusing extensions to jury service, employment, family law
Competitive exclusion: The Fourteenth Amendment (Equal Protection) provided an alternative meme that could be gradually expanded to cover sex discrimination without directly invoking the threatening Nineteenth Amendment
Only after cultural proto-norms shifted (1960s-1970s feminist movement, changing labor force participation) did the Nineteenth Amendment's memetic fitness increase. But by then, Equal Protection Clause had already occupied the doctrinal niche, making Nineteenth Amendment redundant—permanent functional extinction despite formal validity.
Key insight: Formal validity (Kelsen's criterion) does not guarantee memetic fitness. Constitutional provisions conflicting with inherited proto-norms face extinction pressures even when textually supreme. The Grundnorm is not "obey the constitution"—it's "obey constitutional provisions aligned with proto-normative intuitions; evade or neutralize those in conflict."
6.3 European Union: Grundnorm Without Constitution
The Puzzle: The EU lacks a formal constitution (the Constitutional Treaty was rejected by French and Dutch referendums in 2005). Yet the EU functions as a legal order with hierarchical norms, supremacy over national law, and direct effect in member states. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issues binding rulings, enforces Treaty provisions against member states, and invalidates national laws conflicting with EU law—all without a constitutional text formally establishing CJEU authority.
Under Kelsen's theory, this is incoherent. A legal order requires a Grundnorm specifying the source of validity. But what is the EU's Grundnorm? Candidates:
Treaties: But treaties are international agreements, not constitutions. What gives them domestic supremacy?
National constitutions: But national constitutions authorize EU membership in conflicting ways (some require constitutional supremacy, others don't). No unified Grundnorm.
CJEU decisions: But CJEU derives authority from Treaties, creating circularity.
Kelsen has no answer. The EU appears to be a legal order without a Grundnorm—a logical impossibility in Pure Theory.
EPT Explanation: The EU's Grundnorm is a cultural meme, not a textual provision: "Preserve European peace through progressive economic integration." This meme has exceptionally high fitness in post-WWII European political ecology because:
Evolutionary salience: Two catastrophic wars (1914-1918, 1939-1945) created extreme selection pressure against nationalism
Living memory: Generations with direct war experience transmitted anti-war memes culturally
Reciprocity intuition: Economic integration triggers proto-normative reciprocity mechanisms (trade benefits mutual, violating norms harms all)
Fairness institutionalization: EU structural funds redistribute from rich to poor regions, activating fairness proto-norms
This cultural meme functions as the operational Grundnorm: when national law conflicts with EU law, courts and officials resolve the conflict by asking "which interpretation better serves European integration?" Formal legal reasoning (treaty text, CJEU precedent) provides post-hoc rationalization, but the foundational commitment is to the peace-through-integration meme.
Evidence: Brexit validates the model. UK rejected the EU Grundnorm meme—British political culture maintained higher fitness for "parliamentary sovereignty" meme than "European integration" meme. Once memetic commitment eroded (2016 referendum), formal legal ties dissolved rapidly despite Treaties, CJEU rulings, and economic costs. The EU's Grundnorm was never purely formal—it was always cultural-memetic, and when memetic fitness dropped below threshold, legal validity collapsed.
Key insight: International legal orders can operate without formal constitutions if they align with inherited proto-normative psychology. The EU succeeds because it activates fairness (redistribution), reciprocity (trade), and peace (cooperation) proto-norms. When these memetic foundations erode (as in UK), formal legal structures become inoperative regardless of textual validity.
VII. Objections and Responses
7.1 The Naturalistic Fallacy Objection
Objection: This paper commits the naturalistic fallacy. It attempts to derive ought from is, arguing that because proto-normative psychology evolved, we therefore ought to follow norms. But evolutionary origins don't generate normative force. Many evolved capacities (aggression, xenophobia, male sexual jealousy) are descriptively real yet normatively wrong.
Response: We are not committing the naturalistic fallacy because we are not deriving ought from is. Our argument has a different structure:
What we are NOT arguing:
Proto-normative psychology evolved (IS)
Therefore, we ought to follow norms (OUGHT)
What we ARE arguing:
Humans experience ought-feelings (subjective sense of obligation)
Kelsen could not explain the origin of this ought-feeling except by presupposing it
Evolutionary biology explains the ought-feeling as inherited predisposition
This explanation terminates the regress without circularity
We are explaining the psychological origin of the ought-feeling, not justifying which particular norms ought to be followed. The ought-feeling is a descriptive psychological fact—humans experience some actions as obligatory. Kelsen acknowledged this but treated it as a presupposition. We show it's an evolutionary inheritance.
Critically, explaining where ought-feelings come from does not commit us to endorsing every norm that triggers ought-feelings. Just as explaining fear (evolved predator-avoidance mechanism) doesn't mean every fear is rational, explaining ought-feelings (evolved norm-following mechanism) doesn't mean every norm is just.
The evolutionary account explains why humans have normative psychology, not which norms are objectively correct. It's a meta-ethical explanation compatible with multiple first-order ethical theories.
7.2 The Cultural Variation Objection
Objection: If normative psychology is evolutionarily inherited, we should expect human-universal norms. But norms vary dramatically across cultures—some societies permit polygamy, others forbid it; some require modest dress, others don't; some enforce strict reciprocity, others allow generalized altruism. This cultural variation refutes the claim that proto-normative psychology is genetically inherited.
Response: The objection conflates two distinct claims:
Claim 1 (which we defend): The capacity for proto-normative psychology is inherited (detecting violations, feeling indignation, coordinating punishment)
Claim 2 (which we do not defend): Specific norm content is inherited
Cultural variation in specific norms is fully compatible with universal inherited capacity. Consider language: all humans inherit Universal Grammar (capacity for syntactic structure) yet speak different languages with dramatically different vocabularies and grammars. Universal capacity + cultural transmission = cross-cultural variation in specific content.
Similarly, all humans inherit proto-normative psychology (capacity for norm-detection and enforcement), but specific norms are culturally transmitted and vary across groups. However, the underlying structure of normative systems is universal:
All cultures punish free-riders (though they define "free-riding" differently)
All cultures have fairness norms (though they define "fairness" differently—equality vs. equity vs. hierarchy)
All cultures enforce reciprocity (though expectations differ—balanced vs. generalized reciprocity)
Prediction: Proto-normative psychology constrains which norms can stably transmit. Norms violating basic proto-normative principles (fairness, reciprocity, proportionality) should be unstable cross-culturally—they may be imposed through force but face persistent resistance.
Evidence: Historically imposed norms violating proto-normative intuitions (extreme inequality without reciprocity, arbitrary punishment, non-proportional sanctions) systematically fail. Examples: Chattel slavery (abolished despite economic benefits), totalitarian legal systems (collapsed despite coercive enforcement), poll taxes (repealed despite elite support).
Cultural variation occurs within constraints imposed by inherited proto-normative psychology.
7.3 The Hard Cases Objection
Objection: Even if proto-normative psychology explains simple fairness intuitions, it cannot explain complex legal reasoning. When judges decide novel constitutional questions, trade-off competing rights, or interpret ambiguous statutory language, they are not relying on evolved fairness intuitions—they are engaging in sophisticated linguistic interpretation, policy analysis, and moral reasoning. The Grundnorm for these hard cases cannot be reduced to evolutionary psychology.
Response: This objection correctly identifies a limit of the evolutionary account but overstates its implications. We do not claim that all legal reasoning reduces to proto-normative intuitions—we claim that proto-normative psychology provides the foundation upon which complex legal reasoning is built.
Analogy: Arithmetic is built on evolved numerosity intuitions (subitizing, approximate number system), but calculus is not reducible to these intuitions. Calculus is a cultural elaboration built atop evolved cognitive foundations. Yet without inherited numerosity capacity, calculus would be impossible.
Similarly:
Proto-normative psychology provides foundations (fairness, reciprocity, proportionality)
Complex legal reasoning is cultural elaboration built atop these foundations
In easy cases, proto-normative intuitions directly determine outcomes
In hard cases, multiple proto-norms compete, requiring reflective reasoning to adjudicate
Kelsen's Grundnorm applies to the foundational level—it explains why legal systems in general feel obligatory, not why particular legal interpretations are correct. For particular interpretations, we need additional theories (textualism, purposivism, moral reasoning). But those theories presuppose that law is binding in the first place—and that presupposition is what evolutionary theory explains.
Moreover, even in hard cases, proto-normative intuitions constrain acceptable outcomes. Judicial decisions violating basic fairness generate widespread resistance (e.g., Dred Scott, Plessy, Korematsu—cases later recognized as wrongly decided). This resistance reflects conflict between doctrinal reasoning and proto-normative psychology. Over time, proto-normative intuitions shape doctrine, not vice versa.
7.4 The Normativity Objection
Objection: Even granting that proto-normative psychology is evolutionarily inherited, this doesn't capture what philosophers mean by normativity. Genuine normativity involves categorical obligation—obligations that bind regardless of desires, emotions, or evolutionary history. Explaining that humans feel obligated doesn't explain why they are obligated.
Response: This objection assumes that "genuine normativity" requires categorical obligation independent of psychology—but this assumption is precisely what our argument challenges.
Kelsen recognized that legal normativity is not categorical in the Kantian sense—it's conditional on accepting the Grundnorm. If you don't presuppose the Grundnorm, the entire legal system lacks normative force for you. Kelsen's move was to say "we must presuppose it for legal cognition to be possible," but this makes normativity epistemological, not metaphysical.
Our account is structurally similar: Legal normativity is conditional on having human proto-normative psychology. If you lack this psychology (psychopaths have reduced vmPFC function), legal norms lack psychological force. But for normal humans—who inherit proto-normative predispositions through gene-culture coevolution—legal norms do carry psychological force. This force is subjective (it's a feeling), but it's real and causally efficacious.
The philosophical demand for "obligation independent of psychology" may be incoherent. Obligation is a mental state—the feeling that something is required. If we explain why humans have this mental state (evolutionary inheritance), we have explained normativity as it actually functions in human legal systems.
Alternative: If "genuine normativity" requires grounding in metaphysical facts independent of psychology (Platonic Forms, Divine Command, Moral Realism), then Kelsen's project was impossible from the start. Kelsen wanted normativity without metaphysics—a purely formal account. But purely formal accounts can't generate normative force; they can only presuppose it. Our account provides what Kelsen needed: an empirical grounding for normative force that doesn't collapse into metaphysics but also doesn't leave normativity mysteriously presupposed.
VIII. Conclusion: An Evolutionary Alternative to Transcendental Presupposition
Hans Kelsen's Grundnorm represented the most sophisticated attempt in twentieth-century legal philosophy to terminate the infinite regress of legal validity without collapsing law into morality, politics, or sociology. For 80 years, scholars have recognized both the architectural elegance of Kelsen's system and the persistent problem at its foundation: the Grundnorm must be presupposed without justification, yet no satisfactory account explains why this particular presupposition is necessary or warranted.
This paper has proposed an alternative framework grounded in evolutionary biology. Rather than treating the Grundnorm as a transcendental-logical presupposition, we suggest it may reflect an evolutionary inheritance—proto-normative systems that evolved over millions of years to solve cooperation problems through multilevel selection.
8.1 Convergent Evidence for an Evolutionary Hypothesis
Four independent lines of empirical evidence appear consistent with this evolutionary account:
Primatology: Third-party punishment—the hallmark of normative enforcement—appears in capuchins and bonobos despite their divergence from humans 35 million and 6 million years ago, respectively. These proto-normative systems operate without linguistic articulation of deontic rules.
Archaeology: Material evidence of normative exclusion (burial denial as punishment) appears in the archaeological record 100,000 years ago, predating complex deontic language by tens of thousands of years.
Developmental Psychology: Fairness intuitions and third-party punishment emerge in human children at age 3, before productive mastery of deontic modal language. This ontogenetic pattern suggests normative cognition may develop independently of linguistic sophistication.
Neuroscience: Brain regions processing normative violations (vmPFC, TPJ) are phylogenetically older and functionally dissociable from language-specialized circuits, suggesting normative cognition may operate independently of linguistic processing.
While none of these findings definitively proves the evolutionary hypothesis, their convergence across multiple independent methodologies provides initial support for the claim that proto-normative psychology predates—and therefore cannot be reducible to—linguistic articulation.
8.2 Theoretical Implications if the Account Is Correct
If this evolutionary framework withstands further scrutiny, several implications follow for legal philosophy:
First, the concept of legal validity may require reformulation. Rather than deriving purely from hierarchical position within a norm system, validity might depend partly on alignment between formal legal rules and inherited proto-normative intuitions. This could explain why some formally valid laws face systematic resistance while others generate spontaneous compliance.
Second, international law's binding force might be understood differently. Rather than deriving from sanctions or presupposed Grundnorms, compliance might reflect activation of inherited norm-following predispositions. This could account for treaty compliance even in the absence of robust enforcement mechanisms.
Third, the success or failure of legal transplants might become more predictable. Constitutional provisions that conflict sharply with proto-normative principles (fairness, reciprocity, proportionality) may generate predictable patterns of non-compliance, regardless of formal enactment procedures.
Fourth, Kelsen's core insight might be preserved while his explanation is revised. His recognition that legal systems require a foundational norm not derivable from the system itself appears correct. But rather than treating this norm as a logical presupposition, it might be understood as a psychological inheritance shaped by evolutionary processes.
8.3 Limitations and Future Research Directions
This paper presents a theoretical framework and preliminary evidence, not a definitive resolution. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment:
Empirical gaps remain. While the four evidence streams converge suggestively, each requires further validation. Comparative primatology needs larger sample sizes across more species. Archaeological interpretations remain contested. Developmental studies need replication in more diverse cultural contexts. Neuroscientific findings require integration with more sophisticated evolutionary models.
Theoretical work continues. The formal model presented in Section V simplifies complex evolutionary dynamics. More sophisticated models incorporating frequency-dependent selection, cultural transmission rates, and gene-culture feedback loops would strengthen the theoretical foundation.
Philosophical questions persist. Even if the evolutionary account explains the origin of ought-feelings, questions remain about which norms we ought to follow. Evolutionary origins don't settle normative questions—they provide context for understanding why normative questions arise in the first place.
Alternative explanations exist. Other frameworks might account for the same empirical patterns. Future work should develop competing predictions to adjudicate between evolutionary accounts and rival theories.
8.4 A Research Program, Not a Final Answer
Rather than claiming to have solved Kelsen's paradox, this paper proposes a research program: investigating whether legal normativity has evolutionary foundations that predate and constrain linguistic articulation. The program generates testable predictions:
Cross-cultural universality of certain proto-normative structures
Developmental emergence patterns in diverse populations
Neural dissociations between normative and linguistic processing
Predictable patterns in legal transplant success based on proto-normative alignment
If these predictions withstand empirical testing, the evolutionary framework gains credibility. If they fail, alternative accounts must be developed.
8.5 Reframing the Question
Perhaps Kelsen asked the wrong question. He sought a logical presupposition that makes legal cognition possible. But the deeper question may be: Why do humans experience ought-feelings in the first place? Why does normativity feel binding rather than merely prudent or conventional?
Evolution offers a possible answer: Normative psychology evolved because groups with proto-normative enforcement outcompeted groups without such systems. The ought-feeling is as real as fear, attachment, or disgust—an evolved emotional response that guides behavior. We cannot simply choose to stop feeling normative obligation, any more than we can choose to stop feeling fear of predators.
This is not a reduction of law to biology. Legal systems are cultural elaborations built atop evolved foundations. But elaboration requires foundation, and Kelsen never provided one that avoided either circularity or infinite regress. Evolutionary theory offers what philosophy alone perhaps cannot: a naturalistic account of normative origins that terminates regress through causal explanation rather than logical presupposition.
8.6 Concluding Observation
The Grundnorm may not be presupposed—it may be inherited. If correct, this reframes legal philosophy's foundational question. We need not ask "What must we presuppose for law to be valid?" but rather "What evolved capacities make legal systems possible?"
This is not the end of jurisprudence but a potential new beginning—one grounded in empirical investigation of human normative psychology rather than a priori reasoning about transcendental conditions. Whether this evolutionary alternative ultimately proves viable remains to be determined through continued interdisciplinary research.
Kelsen glimpsed something profound: legal systems require a foundation that cannot be derived from positive law alone. His error may have been seeking that foundation in logic rather than biology. The Grundnorm is real—but its reality may be evolutionary, not transcendental.
